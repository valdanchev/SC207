Startling satellite images show the fires currently ravaging Australia‚Äôs east coast are clearly visible from space, with smoke billowing hundreds of kilometres across the Pacific Ocean.
As of 7pm on Saturday, three people are dead, five are missing, 30 people are injured and more than 150 homes have been destroyed by the wild fires razing Australia‚Äôs drought-stricken east coast.
Timelapse imagery shared by meteorologist and scientist Dakota Smith on Twitter shows the path of the fires growing, and smoke pouring out across the ocean:

At least 100 homes have been lost and dozens of people have been injured so far in the unprecedented Spring bushfires .
Firefighters had warned they were in ‚Äúuncharted territory‚Äù as they struggled to contain dozens of blazes from suburban Brisbane to the far outskirts of Sydney.
‚ÄúAt this stage, it appears at least 100 homes have been destroyed in yesterday‚Äôs bush fires,‚Äù New South Wales fire service said in an update early Saturday.

This is a dramatic start to what scientists predict will be a tough fire season ahead, with climate change and unfavourable weather cycles helping create a tinderbox of strong winds, low humidity and high temperatures.

‚Äî Matt Hope (@MattHope4) November 8, 2019 While conditions eased markedly in some areas and the forecast was downgraded from ‚Äúextreme‚Äù to ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ‚Äúvery high‚Äù Saturday, a total fire ban remained in place in many areas and further high winds were predicted.
Firefighters had described the conditions Friday as ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, many people have called for help but due to the size and speed of the fires we couldn‚Äôt get to everyone, even by road or helicopter,‚Äù New South Wales firefighters said.
In some areas, residents were stuck and told to simply ‚Äúseek shelter as it is too late to leave‚Äù.
Local radio stopped normal programming and provided instructions about how to try to survive fires if trapped at home or in a vehicle.

Across the central coast, residents took to social media to post photos and videos of smoke-laden tangerine skies and flames engulfing storeys-tall eucalypts within sight of their homes.
Authorities said some of the fires were creating their own weather conditions: pyrocumulus clouds that enveloped entire towns.
Meanwhile, high winds flung embers and burnt debris far ahead of the fires‚Äô front lines, depositing the dangerous detritus on the balconies and front yards of unsuspecting residents.
Firefighters moved from spot to spot trying to put out small fires caused by the falling debris.
Despite easing conditions, a prolonged drought and low humidity levels will continue to make circumstances combustible.
Earlier this month some of the same fires cloaked Sydney in hazardous smoke for days, giving the city a higher concentration of particles per million than cities like Bangkok, Jakarta or Hong Kong.
That prompted health authorities to warn Sydneysiders with respiratory problems to avoid outdoor physical activity.
Swathes of Australia have gone months without adequate rainfall, forcing farmers to truck in water at exorbitant cost, sell off livestock or leave their land to lay fallow.

2,Hong Kong,China imposes online gaming curfew for minors in bid to fight addiction - CNN,"Hong Kong (CNN) China has announced a curfew on online gaming for minors among new measures aimed at curbing video game addiction.
The official government guidelines will be applied to all online gaming platforms operating in the country, mostly notably Tencent , the world's biggest gaming company. Under the new rules, gamers aged under 18 will be banned from playing online games between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. On weekdays, minors can only play for 90 minutes, while they may play up to three hours per day on weekends and public holidays. The guidelines also place restrictions on the amount of money minors can transfer to their online gaming accounts. Gamers aged between eight and 16 years old can only top up 200 yuan ($29) per month, while the maximum amount for those between 16 and 18 will be 400 yuan ($57). China is the world's largest gaming market , accounting for a quarter of global revenue, according to market research firm Newzoo. It expected China's total gaming revenue to reach $38 billion in 2018. Read More The document was issued by China's General Administration of Press and Publication on Tuesday. China is the world's largest gaming market, with an expected total gaming revenue of $38 billion in 2018. Speaking to the state-run Xinhua News Agency , a spokesman for the administration said the new rules were aimed at creating a ""clear internet space"" and ""protecting the physical and mental health of minors."" ""(This notice) has emphasized on the responsibility of the corporations, and has executed the government's duty to supervise the problem,"" the spokesman said. He said that government units would be required to study the rules and ensure corporations abide by the requirements. The administration is also working with police to set up a real-name registration system, and to enable gaming companies to check the identity of their users against the national database, he added. The new guidelines are China's latest move in an ongoing campaign to increase regulation of the gaming industry. In August 2018, Beijing announced plans to limit the number of new online games to ""reduce nearsightedness in children and adolescents."" It also criticized a popular mobile game, "" Honor of Kings "", for allegedly causing addiction in young people in 2017. Addiction to gaming, known officially as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), was added to the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases for the first time in June 2018. IGD is diagnosed when an online gamer plays compulsively to the exclusion of other interests, including school and family life. A 2018 study carried out by researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine showed that men may be more susceptible to gaming addiction.",2019-11-06T02:00:00.000+02:00,cnn.com,hong_kong|*|cnn|*|china|*|announce|*|curfew|*|online|*|gaming|*|minor|*|new|*|measure|*|aim|*|curb|*|video|*|game|*|addiction|*|official|*|government|*|guideline|*|apply|*|online|*|gaming|*|platform|*|operate|*|country|*|notably|*|tencent|*|world|*|big|*|gaming|*|company|*|new|*|rule|*|gamer|*|age|*|ban|*|play|*|online|*|game|*|weekday|*|minor|*|play|*|minute|*|-pron-|*|play|*|hour|*|day|*|weekend|*|public|*|holiday|*|guideline|*|place|*|restriction|*|money|*|minor|*|transfer|*|-pron-|*|online|*|gaming|*|account|*|gamer|*|age|*|year_old|*|yuan|*|month|*|maximum|*|yuan|*|china|*|world_large|*|gaming|*|market|*|account|*|quarter|*|global|*|revenue|*|accord|*|market|*|research|*|firm|*|newzoo|*|-pron-|*|expect|*|china|*|total|*|gaming|*|revenue|*|reach|*|billion|*|read|*|document|*|issue|*|china|*|general|*|administration|*|press|*|publication|*|tuesday|*|china|*|world_large|*|gaming|*|market|*|expected|*|total|*|gaming|*|revenue_of_billion|*|speak|*|state|*|run|*|xinhua|*|news|*|agency|*|spokesman|*|administration|*|new|*|rule|*|aim|*|create|*|clear|*|internet|*|space|*|protect|*|physical|*|mental|*|health|*|minor|*|notice|*|emphasize|*|responsibility|*|corporation|*|execute|*|government|*|duty|*|supervise|*|problem|*|spokesman|*|-pron-|*|government|*|unit|*|require|*|study|*|rule|*|ensure|*|corporation|*|abide|*|requirement|*|administration|*|work|*|police|*|set|*|real|*|registration|*|system|*|enable|*|gaming|*|company|*|check|*|identity|*|-pron-|*|user|*|national|*|database|*|-pron-|*|add|*|new|*|guideline|*|china|*|late|*|ongoing|*|campaign|*|increase|*|regulation|*|gaming|*|industry|*|august|*|beijing|*|announce|*|plan|*|limit|*|number|*|new|*|online|*|game|*|reduce|*|nearsightedness|*|child|*|adolescent|*|-pron-|*|criticize|*|popular|*|mobile|*|game|*|honor|*|king|*|allegedly|*|cause|*|addiction|*|young|*|people|*|addiction|*|gaming|*|know|*|officially|*|internet|*|gaming|*|disorder|*|igd|*|add|*|world|*|health|*|organization|*|international|*|classification|*|diseases|*|time|*|june|*|igd|*|diagnose|*|online|*|gamer|*|play|*|compulsively|*|exclusion|*|interest|*|include|*|school|*|family|*|life|*|study|*|carry|*|researcher|*|shanghai|*|jiao|*|tong|*|university|*|school|*|medicine|*|man|*|susceptible|*|gaming|*|addiction
3,Hong Kong,Trump made 96 false claims last week - CNNPolitics,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump was relentlessly dishonest last week about the scandal over his dealings with Ukraine, making false claims about just about every component of the story.
Trump made 96 false claims last week, the second-highest total of the 16 weeks we've counted at CNN. He made 53 false claims last Monday alone -- a remarkable 31 in rambling comments at his Cabinet meeting and 22 more in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. Fifty-three false claims is by far the most Trump has made in any day in the 16 weeks we've tracked, beating the previous high of 41. Trump has averaged about 68 false claims per week over the 16-week period -- just shy of 10 false claims per day. His deception last week was focused on his conduct toward Ukraine and Democrats' related impeachment inquiry. Deep breath now: He falsely claimed he had released an exact transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He falsely claimed he did not ask Zelensky for anything on the call. He falsely claimed people aren't talking about the call anymore. Read More He falsely claimed the whistleblower complaint about the call was ""totally wrong."" He falsely claimed the whistleblower alleged he had made seven or eight mentions of a ""quid pro quo."" He falsely claimed the whistleblower has vanished. He falsely claimed Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff was the whistleblower's source. He falsely claimed Schiff had spoken about the call at a committee hearing before, not after, the release of the rough transcript. He falsely claimed Schiff's committee comments were illegal. He falsely claimed Republicans aren't allowed to ask questions in Democrats' impeachment inquiry hearings. And he falsely claimed those closed-door hearings are unprecedented. The most egregious false claim: Trump's ""prediction"" about Osama bin Laden The President complained that the media doesn't want to talk about his declaration, in a 2000 book, that Osama bin Laden needed to be killed. In fact, he didn't say anything like that. The President claimed that things would be different today if his prescient words had been listened to. Again, those words do not exist. The President claimed that he still has people coming up to him marveling at his amazing ""prediction"" about bin Laden. Again, he did not make any prediction about bin Laden. And the president claimed that it was an especially remarkable prediction because ""nobody"" had ever heard of bin Laden at the time. Bin Laden was being pursued by the CIA and had been put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list the year before. Here's a full fact check of Trump's elaborate fiction. The most revealing false claim: How people ""don't talk"" about his call with Ukraine's president Trump's phone call with Zelensky is at the center of Democrats' push to impeach him. It remains the subject of discussion in the media and in the impeachment inquiry hearings. Trump said last week: ""They don't talk about it anymore."" ""They don't like to talk about the phone call,"" he told Hannity, ""because it was perfect."" Most politicians spin, exaggerate, mislead. Trump invites people to join him in a fantasyland that bears no resemblance to what they can see with their own eyes. The most absurd false claim: George Washington's ""two desks"" Trump is fond of adding vivid little details to his tales to theoretically make them sound more authentic. Attempting last week to defend himself against criticism of his aborted plan to hold a G7 summit at one of his own resorts, he claimed that George Washington not only ran a business while in office -- Washington was a major landowner and took an active interest in his farm, so there's at least a smidgen of truth there -- but that Washington, ""they say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk."" For good measure, Trump gestured as if there were two desks near him, side-by-side. Fact checking Trump involves asking weird questions to experts who do not traditionally get roped into articles on the dishonesty of elected officials. In this case, one of our recruits was Mary Thompson, a research historian at Mount Vernon, Washington's historic home. ""I am not aware of Washington having had two desks in the study in the presidential mansion, which was a fairly small room,"" Thompson said. Here's a full fact check of this claim . And below is this week's full list of 96, starting with the ones we haven't included in a weekly update before: Polls, elections and accomplishments Trump's poll numbers ""And I had great polls. I have my best polls now. I think it's because people think that it's terrible what they're doing. Pelosi, Shifty Schiff, Schumer -- these people are trying to destroy the country."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting ""I do say this -- and I can see it, because I've been -- I mean, look at our fundraising. The money's never come in like this. Look at -- my poll numbers have been, like, the highest."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : Trump did not say what polls he was referring to, but there is no sign that he is at his ""highest"" or ""best"" level ever or that there has been any kind of spike in his numbers as a result of Democrats' impeachment push. Trump was at 41.8% approval and 54.1% disapproval in the FiveThirtyEight polling aggregate on the day of these comments, October 21. That was down from 43.8% approval and 52.1% disapproval on September 25, his recent peak. Trump was above 44% approval at various points of 2017 and 2018. Trump's approval numbers with Republicans in particular are consistently over 80%, but even these numbers were not at their peak at the time he spoke here. People crying ""We revoked the ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. ... When I did that, I had people in my office -- I had miners and I had farmers and I had builders building homes. And many of them were tough, strong men and women. And almost all of them were crying. They said, 'Sir, you've given our life back to us.'"" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : We checked the video of this 2017 event, and nobody standing behind Trump was crying. (Trump had previously claimed that ""half"" of the people behind him were crying.) A report from ""Moody's"" Trump spoke three times about data on household income growth under himself and Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. He said all three times that the figures were from ""Moody's."" Facts First : These figures were not from Moody's, company spokesman Gene Kim confirmed; they were produced by a different firm, Sentier Research. (Trump might well just have been confused -- he did refer correctly to a recent Moody's analysis that found he is on track to win the 2020 election if the economy remains roughly as it is today.) The Sentier Research data had been recently referenced by Stephen Moore, an economic fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor. Median household income and energy ""A recent analysis found that middle class income has risen by $5,000. But add to that -- that's median household income -- add to that $2,000 from the tax cuts and then $2,000 for energy, because our energy is much cheaper. ... And so that would be $9,000 per household. Median income."" -- October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First : There is no basis to add ""$2,000 for energy"" on top of the $5,000 figure for median household income. The $5,000 figure came from Sentier Research , a private company run by former Census Bureau officials. The company uses a different methodology than the Census Bureau, and the Trump-era household income increase it calculated is much larger than the increase the Census Bureau itself found between 2016 and 2018. Whichever figure is more accurate, there is no credible estimate that the median household gained ""$2,000 for energy"" over and above the $5,000 overall pre-tax gain found by Sentier. Household energy costs have increased since Trump took office, as have gasoline costs . The Sentier data and inflation ""You know, a number just came out ... under the Bush administration, for eight years, median household income went up $400. That's over eight years. OK? So, remember: $400, eight years ... so remember this: eight years, eight years, 400 bucks -- 400 bucks. You don't even -- that gets wiped out by inflation. Four hundred dollars."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : As the Washington Post noted , Trump was incorrect that the $400 median household income increase under Bush ""gets wiped out by inflation."" The Sentier data is already adjusted for inflation, company partner Gordon Green confirmed. The construction of the Empire State Building ""America built the Empire State Building in just one year. Believe it or not, in nine months."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : The Empire State Building was built in 13 months , not nine months. (We'd have let it go if Trump had stuck to ""just one year,"" but nine months is objectively wrong.) The pace of road approvals ""... I mean, roads are under consideration for -- we have roads, 21 years, 22 years. They end up costing many, many times more... But permits that took 17, 18, 19 years, we think we can get -- we're down to two years. And we think we can get it around one. And you may get rejected, folks, but it's going to be fast."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for ""roads,"" though he was not very specific about which roads he was talking about. According to the Federal Highway Administration's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) page , the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016. A White House report in December 2018 found an average environmental impact statement completion time of 4.5 years and median completion time of 3.6 years across the government, for various kinds of projects. Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has ""never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it's certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more."" He said some projects can ""sail through"" much faster than the median time, ""but to suggest as Trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense."" The governor of Louisiana ""...In Louisiana the other night, the governor was at 66 -- he couldn't get 50%."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : Trump was vague here, but Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards was not ""at 66"" either in the polls or in his previous election. Edwards got 56% of the vote when he was elected in 2015; public polls listed by FiveThirtyEight did not have him higher than 55% in this year's open primary. The Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines ""In my first week in office, I approved permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. And that's a big thing."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : This was not quite what happened. Trump did sign an executive order in his first week in office to advance both pipelines, but he did not grant final approval of Keystone XL until just over two months into his presidency. The Army announced during Trump's third week in office that it would grant the final permits for the Dakota Access Pipeline. A Quote: from Charlie Kirk "" '... Our studends (sic) feel EMPOWERED. There's a movement happening on these campuses like I've never seen before. When you have 3000 students wanting to get into an event that couldn't get in, that's pretty remarkable!' @charliekirk11 Turning Point USA KEEP AMERICA GREAT!"" -- October 23 tweet Facts First : Trump's tweet omitted an important part of Kirk's Quote: on Fox News: Kirk's reference to protests at an event featuring himself and Donald Trump Jr. The President also added a hyperbolic statement Kirk did not utter in this Quote: . Introducing Kirk, the founder of conservative organization Turning Point USA, the hosts of Fox & Friends made mention of the protests around the event at Colorado State University. Kirk said: ""There's a movement happening on these campuses. There were some of the protests from the non-students in the local area, but when you have 3,000 people that wanted to get but couldn't get out, that's pretty remarkable!"" Trump replaced Kirk's reference to the protests with his own words, ""like I've never seen before."" A Quote: from Steve Doocy ""A majority do not want him Impeached and removed from office. 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That's squarely in his corner.'"" @SteveDoocy -- October 22 tweet Facts First : Trump's tweet omitted a significant part of Doocy's Quote: : Doocy noted that this poll showed that a majority of those polled supported House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Doocy, a co-host of Fox & Friends, actually said, ""A majority is for the inquiry but do not want him impeached and removed from office, and it also said that I think 94% of the people in these battleground states who voted for President Trump want him to continue as President. That's squarely in his corner."" The impeachment inquiry Republicans and the impeachment inquiry ""But no lawyers -- we have no lawyers -- Republican -- because it's the minority. We have no lawyers, we can't question, we can't do a thing. We can't -- they can't even go into the room..."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : Trump was correct that the Democratic House majority was not permitting White House lawyers into its closed hearings. However, the 48 Republican members of the three committees holding the hearings -- Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight -- were indeed allowed into the room, and they were given equal time to question witnesses. Trump might have been referring to a stunt in which Republicans who were not members of any of the three committees, along with some Republicans who were members, stormed the secure committee room to make a political point; the non-members were not allowed to be there. But the members were allowed to be full participants in the proceedings. Closed-door impeachment meetings ""Well, I think they are -- I will be honest: I loved when I saw that scene of the unity yesterday with the congressmen going downstairs, because they have a cabal going on. It's -- you know, you look at what's happening downstairs in the little room -- that little secret room. Nobody ever had a thing like that. That's never happened before."" -- October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group's Eric Bolling Facts First : It's not true that ""nobody ever had a thing like"" the closed-door hearings House Democrats are holding as part of their impeachment inquiry. The impeachment processes for both Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon also involved closed-door meetings in which members of Congress gathered evidence. ""The President's comments are entirely, wholly, and completely, wrong,"" said Jeffrey Engel, founding director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. ""It is simply normal for those discussions to take place behind closed doors because as everyone across the board will tell you, in investigations you get better answers when there are no cameras."" The impeachment witnesses ""They're interviewing -- they're interviewing ambassadors who I'd never heard of. I don't know who these people are. I never heard of them. And I have great respect for some of them. ... Don't forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era. You know, you had a Never Trump or Bush."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : As FactCheck.org noted : ""Actually, among the nine government officials who have testified in closed sessions so far, just two were appointed to their current or recently resigned positions under the Obama administration. The other seven were appointed by Trump or Trump appointees, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."" We can't definitively fact check whether Trump has heard of his own appointees, but it's worth noting that they are indeed his own appointees, that he professed respect for ""some of them"" immediately after saying he'd never heard of them, and that he has a history of minimizing his relationships with former associates when that is convenient for him. Democrats Barack Obama and Kim Jong Un ""But in the meantime, North Korea, I like Kim, he likes me. We get along. I respect him, he respects me. 'You could end up in a war.' President Obama told me that. He said, 'The biggest problem, I don't know how to solve it.' He told me he doesn't know how to solve it. I said, 'Did you ever call him?' 'No.' Actually, he tried 11 times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. OK? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.'"" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : There is no apparent basis for the claim that Obama tried to call Kim Jong Un 11 times. In fact, there is no evidence that Obama called him even once. His former national security officials say he did not. Read our full fact check here . Conor Lamb and Trump ""So, Conor Lamb -- right here from Pittsburgh. And I appreciate -- Conor, whoever you are -- I have no idea what you even look like. But there's some guy named Conor Lamb who speaks very nicely about -- you know why? Because you're in like a Trump district. No, it's right. It's true. Right? 'No, the President is excellent. He's doing a good job.' I thought he was a Republican until I found out."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : Lamb, a Democratic congressman in Pennsylvania who has positioned himself as a moderate, has made an effort to avoid attacking Trump, expressed a willingness to work with Trump, and expressed qualified support for Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum (he called for a focus on China rather than allies like Canada) -- but Lamb has not called Trump ""excellent"" or said ""he's doing a good job."" Trump has previously exaggerated how positive Lamb has been toward him, falsely claiming Lamb had endorsed the Trump tax law Lamb had campaigned against. Conor Lamb and guns ""They want to take away your guns. Conor Lamb wants to take away your guns."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : There is no evidence that Lamb ""wants to take away your guns."" Lamb says he supports universal background checks, but he opposes a ban on assault weapons and says new gun laws are not the answer to the problem of mass shootings. Obama's response to Russian election interference ""And President Obama in September (2016) was told about Russian influence, and he didn't want to do anything about it. He didn't want to do a thing about it. Because he assumed Hillary was going to win. So he didn't do a thing about it. Nobody brings that up."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : Obama has been criticized, even by some Democrats , for not acting more forcefully when he was notified of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Still, it's an exaggeration to say ""he didn't do a thing."" Obama and his senior officials did several things in response to the information. San Francisco and the environment ""I can't believe that Nancy Pelosi's District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment. We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply. Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!"" -- October 26 tweet Facts First: San Francisco does not owe the federal government billions of dollars over its supposed environmental violations. And the claim that pollution from San Francisco's homeless population is ""severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply"" is sharply disputed by environmental experts. In September, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, sent a letter to the governor of California to allege ""deficiencies"" in the state's implementation of federal environmental laws. The letter, which followed a dispute between the Trump administration and the state over automotive emissions standards, is seen by many Democrats, former EPA officials and environmental experts as retaliatory. Regardless of the administration's true motives, the letter did not allege that San Francisco or the state owes the federal government billions. It said San Francisco ""must invest billions of dollars"" to modernize its sewer system; that is not the same thing. Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles and faculty co-director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, noted the absence of evidence for the administration's claims about environmental problems caused by homeless people in San Francisco. ""Trump's tweet is misleading or flatly false on several fronts. Although he claimed in late September that the city's failure to manage its homelessness problem was causing serious water pollution problems from needles and human waste, his EPA has produced no evidence to back up its claim,"" she said. ""In fact, after he made that accusation, EPA sent what is called a notice of violation to San Francisco accusing the City of violating the federal Clean Water Act in the operation of its wastewater and sewer system. EPA made no mention of any problems caused by the homeless population -- you can bet if the agency had any evidence, it would have included mention of the evidence in the letter."" George Washington The presidential salary ""But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I'm surprised, to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so . Washington did not. Although Washington initially declined his salary, he relented after Congress insisted. George Washington's ""two desks"" ""But other presidents, if you look -- other presidents were wealthy. Not huge wealth. George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time. But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say, had two desks: He had a presidential desk and a business desk."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Washington, a major landowner, did continue to own property while serving as president, and he took an interest in his farm at Mount Vernon while in office -- even writing to a United Kingdom official to discuss getting help finding renters for Mount Vernon land. But historians say Trump's claim about Washington having a separate desk for business work is baseless. You can read a longer fact check here . Foreign and military affairs Escaped ISIS prisoners ""General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out -- a small number, relatively speaking -- and they've been largely recaptured."" -- October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First : Trump's anti-ISIS envoy, James Jeffrey, testified to Congress about an hour earlier that he does not know the whereabouts of the escaped prisoners. ""We do not know where they are,"" Jeffrey, who serves as both special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS and as special representative for Syria engagement, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Trump's statements on Iraq and oil ""I always used to say, 'If they're going to go in...' Nobody cared that much, but it got written about. 'If they're going to go in...' I'm sure you've heard the statement, because I made it more than any human being alive. 'If they're going into Iraq, keep the oil.' They never did. They never did."" -- October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First : We could not find any examples of Trump speaking before the war about keeping Iraq's oil. (The White House did not respond to a request for evidence.) As with his stance on the invasion itself, Trump appeared to be describing comments he made during the war as if he made them during the run-up to the war. There was at least slightly more factual basis for this claim than his claim to have opposed the invasion: Trump did have a history of suggesting that the US get or take Middle Eastern countries' oil. In a CNN appearance in 1987, for example, he called for the US to get a percentage of Kuwait's oil in exchange for military protection. The same year, Florida's St. Petersburg Times reported that Trump had suggested in a New Hampshire speech that ""the United States should attack Iran 'and take over some of their oil.' "" But these comments were more than 15 years before the invasion of Iraq, and they were not about Iraq. You can read a longer fact check here . Trump, his book and Osama bin Laden ""You know, if you read my book -- there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don't get any credit for this, but that's OK. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book -- a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, 'There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.' Something to that effect. 'He's big trouble.'"" And: ""I think it was about -- if you check, it was about a year before the World Trade Center came down. And I'm saying to people, 'Take out Osama bin Laden,' that nobody ever heard of. Nobody ever heard of..."" -- October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First : Trump's January 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" mentioned bin Laden once, but it did not call for bin Laden to be killed or warn that he would perpetrate a major attack if he were not killed. In a separate section, the book said the US was in danger of a major terrorist attack that would make the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center look minor in comparison -- but it did not predict that bin Laden or al Qaeda would be the perpetrator of this attack. You can read a longer fact check here . The size of China's economy ""So, if I weren't elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected. It was said by many people that China would, right now -- they were expecting around the second year of this term."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""When I took office, everybody said that China would be the largest economy in the world within the first two years. And we picked up trillions and trillions of dollars of worth, and China has lost trillions of dollars of worth."" -- October 23 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure Facts First : Experts on China did not declare that the Chinese economy would be larger than the American economy within two years of Trump taking office, at least not around the time Trump did take office. ""When the President took office, there were no predictions China would surpass the US in GDP within two years. Their GDP was 60% the size of the US at the time and slowing. They would have had to grow $7.5 trillion to catch us in two years even if we didn't grow at all, which would have required 30% annual increases on their part. No one would predict that,"" said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on the Chinese economy. Scissors said Trump might possibly have been thinking of three things: bad predictions at the start of the decade that China would pass the US around this time; predictions when Trump came into office that China would pass the US before the end of his hypothetical second term; figures that incorporate purchasing power parity rather than measuring the absolute size of the economies. China's economic growth ""We are much bigger than the China economy. And we're getting bigger, and they're not."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : China's economy is getting bigger, though its growth has slowed. China reported 6% economic growth in the third quarter of 2019 -- the weakest growth since 1992 , but growth nonetheless. China's official figures are not always reliable, but there is no doubt that China is growing; the International Monetary Fund expects 6.1% growth in 2019 and 5.8% growth in 2020. Trump's strike against Syria ""I wiped out the caliphate. And you also saw when I hit 58 rockets, missiles right into the middle. Tomahawk, right into the middle of -- of Syria and knocked out a whole base..."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : A Syrian air base did indeed suffer serious damage as a result of the airstrike Trump approved in 2017, but it was not ""knocked out."" The Shayrat base had returned to use by the next day, according to the governor of the province of Homs and a UK-based monitoring organization, Reuters reported . Trump himself acknowledged at the time that the runways had not been destroyed, tweeting : ""The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!"" Hillary Clinton and trade with South Korea ""... as an example, we finished it with South Korea. What a difference that has made. That was a Hillary Clinton deal. She said, 'This will produce 250,000 jobs.' And she was right, except the jobs were produced for South Korea, not for us, OK?"" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : There is no record of Clinton, who served as secretary of state, saying that the US trade deal with South Korea would ""produce 250,000 jobs."" Obama said the deal would ""support at least 70,000 American jobs.""‚ÄÇ Clinton was a key figure in the negotiations over the agreement, known as KORUS, but when Trump calls it a ""Hillary Clinton deal,"" it's worth noting that the agreement was originally signed in 2007 by the George W. Bush administration. The Obama administration renegotiated some of its provisions. The size of Miami International Airport Touting the benefits of his Doral resort in Florida, Trump said, ""Right next to the airport, Miami International --one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it's the biggest. But one of the biggest airports in the world."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Miami International is certainly not the biggest airport in the world. The airport was not in the top 20 for passenger traffic in 2018 or 2017 . It ranked 15th in cargo traffic in 2018 and 14th in 2017, with less than half of the tonnage of cargo of top-ranked Hong Kong. Though world airports authorities do not release rankings of airports' physical size, Miami International is not even close to the largest airport in the United States. Chicago's O'Hare, for example, occupies about 7,200 acres, Miami International 3,230 acres . The Emoluments Clause ""...you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause..."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : There's nothing phony about the Constitution's prohibitions against the President receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments. The clause on foreign emoluments, found in Article I, Section 9, says that ""no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state."" The clause on domestic emoluments, found in Article II, Section 1, says: ""The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them."" Trump might have been attempting to argue that it is phony to apply the clause to his own activities, but, at very least, his wording left an inaccurate impression. A Quote: from Fox & Friends ""General Michael Flynn's attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that FBI Agents manipulated records against him. They say that James Clapper told a reporter to 'take a kill shot at Flynn. This has been a complete setup of Michael Flynn. They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK), and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence & information, as are Clapper & Brennan & all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.' (Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!"" -- October 26 tweet Facts First : We give Trump significant leeway to make minor errors when he is quoting people from television, but he went too far here. Trump attributed to Powell, a lawyer for Flynn, sentences that were actually uttered by Fox & Friends hosts Pete Hegseth and Jedediah Bila. He also added the parenthetical ""Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK,"" which nobody on the show said. You can watch the exchange here . The government's land holdings ""Interior Secretary -- largest landlord in the United States by a factor of about 200 -- David Bernhardt. Where's David? David? Thank you, David. Stand up. What a great job. He's basically the landlord to about half of the United States."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : We know Trump was speaking informally here, but ""half"" is a significant exaggeration. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2017: ""The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States."" The land is managed by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture. An 'apology' from the New York Times ""And then after the election, The New York Times apologized for their coverage, because they were covering me in such a way. So when I won they actually apologized to their subscribers, because they were losing thousands and thousands of subscribers. The New York Times wrote an apology. Nothing else. You know, they're saying well, it wasn't really an apology. It was. Because they covered me so badly."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : The Times' letter was not an apology. The letter , from publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and executive editor Dean Baquet, did say the election had raised several questions, including this: ""Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?"" But the letter did not issue any apology, to Trump or anyone else. Here are the claims Trump made last week that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups: The Ukraine scandal The call with Zelensky Trump said of the phone call: ""There was no anything asked for. There was no pressure whatsoever."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump is free to argue that his requests to Zelensky did not constitute ""pressure,"" but he is simply wrong that he didn't make any requests at all. Trump asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden, into a debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers, and to speak with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. In fact, prior to launching into the request about the server, Trump said, ""I would like you to do us a favor though."" You can read a full fact check of this claim here . The rough transcript ""... I released a transcription then by stenographers of the exact conversation I had."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""So now we have a conversation that's perfect. And it's transcribed. And it's done by totally professional people, stenographers or whatever you would call them. So we have an exact conversation."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : The document released by the White House explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of the call. In testimony on Tuesday, the National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, said that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document, a source told CNN. The whistleblower's accuracy ""You know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they're angels. OK? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation? I don't know. You tell me. "" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting ""And now you don't hear from the whistleblower anymore, because the whistleblower was talking about this conversation -- in phony terms."" And: ""Well, now the funny thing is that they say -- they say that the whistleblower -- they don't need the whistleblower anymore. Why don't they need the whistleblower? You know why they don't need the whistleblower, because the whistleblower's account of my conversation was totally wrong."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""Where is the Whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President?"" -- October 24 tweet ""But everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either), which they don't want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself. The entire Impeachment Scam was based on my perfect Ukrainian call, and the Whistleblowers account of that call, which turned out to be false (a fraud?)."" -- October 25 tweet Facts First : The whistleblower's account of the call has largely been proven accurate. In fact, the rough transcript released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here . Rep. Adam Schiff and the whistleblower ""So was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion it's possibly Schiff."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting ""They don't like to talk about the -- Adam Schiff said he doesn't want the whistleblower anymore. You know why? Because he might have given the whistleblower the things to say."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!"" -- October 24 tweet Facts First : This is nonsensical. Schiff, a Democratic congressman and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not have access to the internal White House information the whistleblower revealed; he could not have told the whistleblower about the contents of Trump's phone call with Zelensky or other information the whistleblower reported. The whistleblower said information about the call came from ""multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call."" Schiff did say that it might not be necessary for the whistleblower to testify. He said it might be possible to uncover critical evidence without jeopardizing the whistleblower's anonymity. The timing of Schiff's comments ""So he made up a lie, and I released -- they never thought that I'd do this -- I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had. And now the game was up."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""For instance, when you do a censure vote on Adam Schiff, what did he do? He made up my conversation, totally -- like fiction. It was -- it was fraudulent. He made it sound -- he took that conversation he made it sound -- now, he didn't know about that conversation. So he went up -- and he made up a phony conversation, read it to Congress, read it the American people. And I released that, and that was the real conversation..."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""If you think -- Schiff made up, his words -- not my words. He went before Congress and the American people and he repeated a conversation that I never had, and then I released the conversation, because we had stenographers and transcribers, and the conversation was a perfect conversation."" -- October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group's Eric Bolling Facts First : Schiff made his comments about Trump's call with Zelensky the day after Trump released the rough transcript, not before. Before he started claiming that Schiff did not expect a transcript to be released, Trump had complained that Schiff did not read the transcript available to him. Even Trump's friendly interviewer here, Fox's Sean Hannity, seemed to be gently correcting him, noting that the conversation ""was already out"" when Schiff spoke. The legality of Schiff's comments ""But he made it sound so horrible. That's illegal. I mean, it -- no way you can get away with that. That's a -- but that's a total fraud."" -- October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group's Eric Bolling Facts First : While it's fair for Trump to be miffed about Schiff's comments at a congressional committee meeting -- Schiff's mix of near-Quote: s from Trump, his own analysis, and supposed ""parody"" was at the very least confusing -- Schiff's words were not illegal. The Constitution includes a specific provision that allows members of Congress to speak freely during official meetings. The whistleblower's knowledge ""The whistleblower had second- and third-hand information. You remember that, it was a big problem."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Some of the whistleblower's information came from others, but some did not. Michael Atkinson, the Trump-appointed inspector general for the intelligence community, noted that the whistleblower had ""direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct."" T he whistleblower and quid pro quo ""And to think they took that call -- now, the big thing I did with that call, Sean, the biggest thing is immediately released it because the whistleblower came out and said horrible things about this call. I think they said there were eight -- seven or eight -- quid pro quos. It was really a terrible call -- you know, all these terrible things about this call."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : The whistleblower did not even use the words ""quid pro quo,"" much less specify a number of times Trump allegedly said them. People talking about Trump's Ukraine call ""The -- one of his (Zelensky's) top people -- I guess, one of his heads of state came out and said this was a perfect call. There was no pressure. They didn't even know what we were talking about. To think that they're using that -- now they don't talk about that anymore, because that letter was so good. So they don't talk about it anymore, Sean. And the reason they don't talk about it: there's nothing to talk about."" And: ""How can you take a President -- now, again, they don't like to talk about the phone call because it was perfect."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : To the contrary, Trump's call with Ukraine's President was the subject of widespread discussion among members of Congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of Democrats' impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower being ""gone"" ""You never hear, what happened to the whistleblower? They're gone, because they've been discredited."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : There is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers say they have firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow ""gone,"" let alone that they are ""gone"" because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate. ""The whistleblowers have not vanished,"" Bradley Moss, a colleague of Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on Twitter. Foreign and military affairs The troops being withdrawn from Syria ""But when I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say -- they say, 'What are we getting out of it?' You know what we're getting out of it? We're bringing our soldiers back home. That's a big thing."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump is not bringing the troops back home, at least not at the moment. Trump has announced that ""United States troops coming out of Syria will now redeploy and remain in the region to monitor the situation and prevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq,"" then that some troops would remain in Syria to protect oil fields. He has also announced that 1,800 more troops would be deployed to Saudi Arabia. Trump conceded later in the Cabinet meeting that the soldiers will be ""sent, initially, to different parts,"" but he claimed that they would ""ultimately"" return to the US. The timeline in Syria ""We won't be fighting, and we'll bring our soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days, and they've been there now for 10 years, in Syria. Ten years."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""We want to bring soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days. They're there for 10 years."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""We were supposed to be there for 30 days; that was almost 10 years ago. So we're there for 30 days, and now we're leaving. It was supposed to be a very quick hit and let's get out."" -- October 23 speech on the situation in Syria ""We were supposed to be there for 30 days - That was 10 years ago."" -- October 25 tweet Facts First : There was never any specific timeline for the US military's involvement in Syria, much less a timeline of a mere 30 days. The US began bombing Syria in 2014 and deployed ground troops in 2015 -- five years ago and four years ago, not 10 years ago. Military spending ""We are building up America's military might like never before, investing $2.5 trillion since my election."" -- October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First : Defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of Obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in October 2016. Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks Trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the ""$2.5 trillion"" figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on October 1, and Harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by Congress. The deal with Turkey ""People have been trying to make this deal for years."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting ""This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else, no other nation. Very simple. And we're willing to take blame, and we're also willing to take credit. This is something they've been trying to do for many, many decades."" -- October 23 speech on the situation in Syria Facts First : Trump's claim is baseless to the point of being nonsensical. The deal is a narrow agreement specifically tied to the Turkish offensive that followed Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from a Kurdish-held region of northern Syria, not an agreement that resolves longstanding regional disputes. Further, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush never sought to give Turkey anything like the concessionary terms of Trump's deal. You can read a longer fact check here . The Iraq War ""If you remember, I didn't want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it. But I always was speaking against going into Iraq."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting. ""If you read about the history of Donald Trump -- I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq, and I was totally against it."" And: ""In Iraq -- so they spent -- President Bush went in. I strongly disagreed with it, even though it wasn't my expertise at the time, but I had a -- I have a very good instinct about things."" -- October 27 press conference after the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Facts First : Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, ""Are you for invading Iraq?"" He responded: ""Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly."" The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, ""It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint."" Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, ""Either you attack or don't attack."" Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2014. You can read a longer fact check here . China and nuclear weapons ""Right now we have the most powerful nuclear force in the world. ... And we are discussing with Russia, and we're discussing with China. During the recent trade deal with China, I said, 'We should all get together and work out something -- a cap, have a cap. We don't need 10,000 weapons, have a cap.' And I will say China and Russia are talking about it. ... I'm very excited about it. ... And I think Russia would like to make a deal, and I think China would like to make a deal. And I think that's a big -- that would be a terrific thing. I'd love to be a part of that."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim that ""China would like to make a deal"" that would limit its nuclear arsenal. While we can't know what Chinese officials might have said to Trump in private, China has publicly expressed vehement opposition to negotiating any limits with the US and Russia. After Trump previously suggested that China wanted to participate in a trilateral deal with the US and Russia, a spokesperson for the Chinese government said in May: ""We oppose any country's attempt to make an issue out of China on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement."" In October, Bloomberg reported that Fu Cong, director general of the foreign ministry's Arms Control Department, had said, ""China has no interest in participating in a nuclear-arms-reduction negotiation with the U.S. or Russia, given the huge gap between China's nuclear arsenal and those of the U.S. and Russia."" Retired Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a CNN military analyst, told us this week: ""China has developed an expansive overarching military strategy and they don't believe submitting to a potentially disadvantageous (for them) arms control regime is in China's best interest. While China did accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, it has never agreed to limits on its short- and intermediate-range missiles. As an ascendant power, China has no real incentive to limit its nuclear arsenal unless it determines that it doesn't need nuclear weapons to achieve its foreign policy goals."" Economy and energy Ivanka Trump and jobs ""Through our Pledge to American Workers, more than 360 companies have committed to providing over 14 million training jobs and career opportunities for the American worker. My daughter, Ivanka, worked so hard on that. That's her love. It's her passion. It's incredible. She came to me at the beginning of the administration, and she said, 'I want to help people get jobs, Dad. But they have to be trained.' She was a great student. She's a great person. And she said, 'But they have to be trained.' I said, 'What's your goal?' She said, '500,000 jobs.' She just hit 14 million. Can you be -- I said, 'That's Ivanka.' You know, that's Ivanka. Fourteen million jobs."" -- October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First : Given that fewer than 6.5 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency through September, Ivanka Trump, the President's daughter and White House adviser, was obviously not responsible for ""14 million jobs."" As Trump alluded to in a slightly more accurate remark earlier in this paragraph, companies have promised to create more than 14 million ""new opportunities"" for workers as of Wednesday -- but many of these ""opportunities"" are internal training opportunities, not new jobs. The web page for the pledge program describes them as ""education and training opportunities."" Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative. The Cameron LNG plant in Louisiana ""Think what that -- I just left Louisiana recently. And we opened a $10 billion LNG plant. I don't know if I've ever seen a longer building. It's like a skyscraper laid on its side. It is the most incredible thing you've ever seen. More pipes in that building that -- nobody realized how complex it is. But it took years and years, and it was a dead project. And I had it approved almost immediately."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : The permits for the Sempra Energy facility Trump visited in May were granted by the Obama administration. The company says on its website: ""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014."" The company confirmed to FactCheck.org: ""You are correct, Cameron LNG was approved in 2014."" The facility made its first shipment in late May. Energy independence ""Since I came in we're now energy independent."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""We're now energy independent. Who would've thought that? That wasn't going to happen for a long time."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : While definitions of ""energy independence"" vary, the US is not ""energy independent"" by any definition; it is expected to export more energy than it imports by 2020, according to the government's Energy Information Administration, but that has not happened yet. In the first five months of 2019, PolitiFact noted, the US also consumed more energy than it produced. There have been occasional, brief periods where US exports have exceed imports or where its production has exceeded consumption, but this hasn't happened for a full recent year. You can read a longer fact check here . The unemployment rate ""Unemployment is at the lowest rate in more than 51 years."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : This was one of Trump's signature little exaggerations. The September rate , 3.5%, was the lowest since December 1969, just under 50 years ago. Unemployment for women Trump said women have their lowest unemployment numbers in ""71 years."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : This was another exaggeration. It has been 66 years since the women's rate has been as low as it was in September, 3.4%, not 71 years. Prescription drug prices ""And we had the first year ever where prices actually went down."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump was exaggerating. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972, not the first one ""ever."" (As The Washington Post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that ""net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018."") China and trade China's economic performance ""China is doing very poorly. Worst year they've had in 57 years. I wonder why. I wonder why. I'm sure you can't figure it out."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""All over the world -- countries aren't doing well. China's not doing well. China's having the worst year they've had in 57 years."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : China's second-quarter GDP growth of 6.2% and third-quarter GDP growth of 6% were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago. Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason. China's agricultural purchases ""Well, one little example is the farmers. So they were told and I was told, if we could get $20 billion a year in purchase -- the biggest they've ever done is $16 (billion), is what I've heard and what they've said. If we could get $20 billion a year from China -- that China purchases $20 billion a year of agricultural product -- that would be a great thing."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture. Who is paying for the tariffs on China ""And we're doing great. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they're eating the tariffs because they devalued their currency."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""Don't forget China's paying us tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, and it's had a huge impact on China. And it hasn't cost us anything because they devalued their currency or they've poured money in. It hasn't cost us -- they've eaten that. They've eaten it totally."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity Facts First : A bevy of economic studies have found that Americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, and Americans make the actual tariff payments. The USMCA and Canada ""We need -- for our farmers, our manufacturers, for, frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it's voted on, it'll pass. It's up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. ... Mexico and Canada have approved it; it's done. They're waiting for our approval. And we can't seem to get the votes."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting ""...and all the things we've done, and we have to get USMCA done, and they don't want to put it up for a vote. And the Do-Nothing Democrats, they will pass it, but it has to be put up Nancy Pelosi. ... It's approved by Mexico. It's approved by Canada. It's approved by everybody that has to be approved. We have to give it a vote. It's been sitting for a long time."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : Mexico's Senate has voted to approve the USMCA trade agreement, but Canada's Parliament has not. (The agreement is highly unlikely to be rejected by Parliament, but still, the voting has not happened yet.) Crowds The crowd in Dallas, part 1 ""I was in Dallas the other night, we set a record in a stadium -- I don't know, it's got to be an arena that's got to be 20 years old ... we have a record."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""I go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump did not break the attendance record at the American Airlines Center. Jason Evans, a spokesman for the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department, told CNN that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. The Dallas Mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the NBA, according to ESPN data . The crowd in Dallas, part 2 Trump said of his rally the previous week in Dallas: ""I had 25,000 people, close, in that arena."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Again, the Dalas Fire-Rescue Department put the number at 18,500. The crowd outside in Dallas Trump said of the Dallas rally: ""And we had 20,000 people outside, at least."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : Trump's estimate was way off, though it was lower than the ""close to 30,000"" he had claimed during the speech. ""We didn't have 30K outside. Probably had upward of 5K outside,"" Dallas Police Department spokesman Sgt. Mitchell Warren told CNN in response to that previous Trump estimate. Rally crowds in general ""I haven't had an empty seat at a rally."" -- October 21 exchange with reporters at Cabinet meeting Facts First : There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including a rally earlier this month in Minneapolis , a July rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene. Trump's approval rating with Republicans ""I love the Republicans. Ninety-four and 95% approval rating they gave me recently."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference Facts First : Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find. Trump was at 90% with Republicans in a CNN poll conducted from October 17-20, 83% with Republicans in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 17-21, 81% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted October 18-22. Special elections in North Carolina ""Look at North Carolina. Great state. Great people. Two races that were going to be lost, I went in, made a speech, let everybody know I really respect these two guys and they're going to be great, they both won. They both won by good margins."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""You saw what happened in North Carolina: We picked up two seats that people didn't think we were going to pick up. That was two weeks ago."" -- October 21 remarks at Cabinet meeting Facts First : The special elections in North Carolina were six weeks ago, not two weeks ago. While the race in the 9th District was considered competitive, the race in the 3rd District was expected by pollsters and analysts to be won easily by the Republican candidate. Both seats had previously been held by Republicans, so the party did not pick them up. (Trump might have just been speaking informally.) Democrats and borders ""Look, I think that the Democrats are not good politicians. I think they have lousy policy. They have policy of open borders and sanctuary cities and crime."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""Their policies are horrible: open borders, sanctuary cities, take everyone's guns away."" -- October 23 speech at Shale Insight Conference ""LOUISIANA! Extreme Democrat John Bel Edwards has sided with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to support Sanctuary Cities, High Taxes, and Open Borders."" -- October 26 tweet Facts First : Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli√°n Castro, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests. The Washington Post ""The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories, with zero sources, that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong."" -- October 26 tweet . Facts First : There is simply no evidence that the Post fabricated its sources for this article . Trump is entitled to argue that the sources aren't correct, but there is no basis for the claim that the sources don't exist. The article began: ""After weeks of dismissing the impeachment inquiry as a hollow partisan attack, President Trump and his closest advisers now recognize that the snowballing probe poses a serious threat to the president -- and that they have little power to block it, according to multiple aides and advisers."" The cost of the Mueller investigation ""It ended with a very poor performance (by Robert Mueller, testifying to Congress). And this is after more than two years of an investigation where they spent $45 million or something like that."" -- October 21 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity ""I fought off the Mueller hoax. I fought off all of them, and it continues. It's just crazy. This has never happened to a president before, and they spend $45 million. ... I could find something on you for $45 million, and you're perfect."" -- October 25 interview with Sinclair Broadcast Group's Eric Bolling ""This is a hoax -- just like there was no collusion. After two years, they found out and wasted $45 million. This is a disgrace that this could happen in our country."" -- October 25 exchange with reporters before Marine One departure ""Spent $45 million, and they found nothing."" -- October 25 speech to 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum Facts First : The Mueller investigation cost $32 million, not $45 million, according to figures released by the Justice Department, and the government is expected recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, according to a CNN analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.

You likely don't have to think for long, and whether you're hungry for a slice of sourdough or craving some tortillas, what you imagine says a lot about where you're from. But if bread is easy to picture, it's hard to define. Bread historian William Rubel argues that creating a strict definition of bread is unnecessary, even counterproductive. ""Bread is basically what your culture says it is,"" says Rubel, the author of ""Bread: A Global History."" ""It doesn't need to be made with any particular kind of flour."" Instead, he likes to focus on what bread does: It turns staple grains such as wheat, rye or corn into durable foods that can be carried into the fields, used to feed an army or stored for winter. Even before the first agricultural societies formed around 10,000 B.C., hunter-gatherers in Jordan's Black Desert made bread with tubers and domesticated grain. Related content 50 of the world's best desserts Today, the descendants of those early breads showcase the remarkable breadth of our world's food traditions. In the rugged mountains of Germany's Westphalia region, bakers steam loaves of dense rye for up to 24 hours, while a round of Armenian lavash made from wheat turns blistered and brown after 30 seconds inside a tandoor oven. Ethiopian cooks ferment injera's ground-teff batter into a tart, bubbling brew, while the corn dough for Venezuelan arepas is patted straight onto a sizzling griddle. This list reflects that diversity. Along with memorable flavor, these breads are chosen for their unique ingredients, iconic status and the sheer, homey pleasure of eating them. In alphabetical order by location, to mark World Bread Day on October 16, here are 50 of the world's most wonderful breads. From the rich layers of Malaysian roti canai to Turkey's seed-crusted simit, they're a journey through the essence of global comfort food -- and a reminder that creativity, like bread, is a human inheritance. Bolani, Afghanistan Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images Golden blisters of crisp dough speckle a perfectly made bolani, but the real treasure of Afghanistan's favorite flatbread is hidden inside. After rolling out the yeast-leavened dough into a thin sheet, Afghan bakers layer bolani with a generous filling of potatoes, spinach or lentils. Fresh herbs and scallions add bright flavor to the chewy, comforting dish, which gets a crispy crust when it's fried in shimmering-hot oil. Lavash, Armenia Shutterstock When your Armenian mother-in-law comes towards you wielding a hula hoop-sized flatbread, don't duck: Lavash is draped over the country's newlyweds to ensure a life of abundance and prosperity. Maybe that's because making lavash takes friends. To shape the traditional breads, groups of women gather to roll and stretch dough across a cushion padded with hay or wool. It takes a practiced hand to slap the enormous sheets onto the inside of conical clay ovens, where they bake quickly in the intense heat. The bread is so central to Armenia's culture it's been designated UNESCO Intangible Heritage . Damper bread, Australia Alamy A traveler's staple suited to life on the road, damper recalls Australia's frontier days. It's a simple blend of water, flour and salt that can be cooked directly in the ashes, pressed into a cast iron pan or even toasted at the end of a stick. These days, recipes often include some chemical leavening, butter and milk, turning the hearty backwoods fare into a more refined treat similar to Irish soda bread. Luchi, Bangladesh Shutterstock A dunk in hot oil turns soft wheat dough into a blistered, golden flatbread that's a perfect pairing with the country's aromatic curries. It's a popular choice for breakfast in Bangladesh, often served with white potato curry, but you can find the puffy breads everywhere from Dhaka sidewalk stalls to home kitchens. P√£o de queijo, Brazil Shutterstock It's a triumph of kitchen ingenuity that South America's native cassava is eaten at all: The starchy root has enough naturally occurring cyanide to kill a human being. But by carefully treating cassava with a cycle of soaking, pressing and drying, many of the continent's indigenous groups found a way to turn the root into an unlikely culinary star. Now, it's the base for one of Brazil's most snackable treats, a cheesy bread roll whose crisp crust gives way to a tender, lightly sour interior. Related content World's 50 most delicious drinks Montreal bagels, Canada Alamy The fire is always lit at Montreal's Fairmount Bagel , which became the city's first bagel bakery when it opened in 1919 under the name Montreal Bagel Bakery. Inside, bakers use long, slender wooden paddles to slide rows of bagels into the wood-fired oven, where they toast to a deep golden color. New Yorkers might think they have a monopoly on bagels, but the Montreal version is an entirely different delicacy. Here, bagel dough is mixed with egg and honey, and the hand-shaped rings are boiled in honey water before baking. The result is dense, chewy and lightly sweet, and you can buy them hot from the oven 24 hours a day. Marraqueta, Chile Shutterstock An influx of European immigrants brought their wheat-bread traditions to Chile in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country's favorite snack has descended from that cultural collision. Split into four lobes, the marraqueta has a pale, fluffy interior, but the ubiquitous roll is all about the crust. Bakers slide a pan of water into the oven to achieve an addictively crispy exterior that is a favorite part of the marraqueta for many Chileans. It's a nourishing part of daily life, to the extent that when a Chilean wants to describe a child born to a life of plenty, they might say ""naci√≥ con la marraqueta bajo el brazo,"" or ""they were born with a marraqueta under their arm."" Shaobing, China Shutterstock Crack into the sesame-seed crust of a shaobing to reveal tender layers that are rich with wheat flavor. Expert shaobing bakers whirl and slap the dough so thin that the finished product has 18 or more layers. The north Chinese flatbread can then be spiked with sweet or savory fillings, from black sesame paste to smoked meat or Sichuan pepper. Pan Cubano, Cuba Shutterstock Melted lard lends a hint of savory flavor to loaves of pan Cubano, whose fluffy crumb offers a tender contrast to the crisp, cracker-like crust. Duck into a Cuban bakery, and you'll likely spot the long, golden loaf with a pale seam down the center: Some bakers press a stripped palmetto leaf into the dough before baking to create a distinctive crack along the length of the bread. It's popular from Havana to Miami, but it's only stateside that you'll find the loaves in ""Cuban sandwiches,"" which are thought to have been invented during the 19th century by Cubans living in Florida. Libba, Egypt Jen Rose Smith Bedouin tribes travel light in Egypt's vast deserts, carrying sacks of wheat flour to make each day's bread in the campfire. While some Bedouin breads are baked on hot metal sheets, libba is slapped directly into the embers. That powerful heat sears a crisp, browned crust onto the soft dough, leaving the inside steaming and moist. Related content World's best Restaurant Awards Pupusas, El Salvador Lane Turner/The Boston Globe/Getty Images Walk the streets of San Salvador, and you'll never be far from the toasted-corn scent of cooking pupusas. The griddled corn bread is both a beloved snack and a national icon. To make pupusas, a cook wraps a filling of cheese, pork or spiced beans into tender corn dough, then pats the mixture onto a blazing-hot griddle. A bright topping of slaw-like curtido cuts through the fat and salt for a satisfying meal. It's a flavor that's endured through the centuries. At the UNESCO-listed site of Joya de Cer√©n , a Maya city buried by an erupting volcano, archaeologists have found cooking tools like those used to make pupusas that date to around 600 A.D. Injera, Ethiopia Alamy A constellation of bubbles pocks injera's spongy surface, making this Ethiopian bread the perfect foil for the country's rich sauces and stews. Also beloved in neighboring Eritrea and Somalia, injera is both a mealtime staple and the ultimate utensil -- tear off tender pieces of moist, rolled-up bread to scoop food served on a communal platter. Made from an ancient -- and ultra-nutritious -- grain called teff, injera has a characteristically sour taste. It's the result of a fermentation process that starts by blending fresh batter with cultures from a previous batch, then leaving the mixture to grow more flavorful over several days. Baguette, France Enrico Spanu/REDA&CO/UIG/Getty Images The French may frown on eating on the go, but there's an unofficial exception for ""le quignon,"" the crisp-baked end of a slender baguette. You're allowed to break that off and munch it as you walk down the street -- perhaps because the baguette has pride of place as a symbol of French culture. But like some of the greatest traditions, the baguette is a relatively recent invention. According to Paris food historian Jim Chevallier , long, narrow breads similar to modern baguettes gained prominence in the 19th century, and the first official mention is in a 1920 price list. (French President Emmanuel Macron nonetheless argues that the baguette deserves UNESCO status .) Khachapuri, Georgia Shutterstock Bubbling with fresh imeruli and sulguni cheeses, khachapuri might be the country of Georgia's most beloved snack. The savory flatbread starts with soft, yeasted dough that's pinched into a boat-shaped cradle, then baked with a generous filling of egg and cheese. An elongated shape maximizes the contrast in texture, from the tender interior to crisp, brown tips. Khachapuri experts know to break off the ends for swabbing in the rich, oozing filling. It's such a key feature of Georgian cuisine that the Khachapuri Index is one measure of the country's economic welfare; and in 2019, the country's National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation named traditional khachapuri as UNESCO Intangible Heritage of Georgia. Pumpernickel, Germany Shutterstock Pure rye flour lends these iconic north German loaves impressive heft, along with a distinctive, mahogany hue. The most traditional versions are baked in a warm, steamy oven for up to 24 hours. It's an unusual technique that helps transform sugars in the rye flour, turning naturally occurring sweetness into depth of flavor. Pumpernickel has been a specialty in Germany's Westphalia region for hundreds of years, and there's even a family-owned bakery in the town of Soest that's made the hearty bread using the same recipe since 1570. Pai bao, Hong Kong Shutterstock Hong Kong bakers outdo each other by crafting the softest, fluffiest breads imaginable, turning wheat flour into pillowy confections. Pai bao might be loftier than all the rest, thanks to a technique known as the Tangzhong method. When mixing the wheat dough, bakers add a small amount of cooked flour and water to the rest of the ingredients, a minor change with major impact on the bread's structural development. The results? A wonderfully tender loaf that retains moisture for days, with a milky flavor that invites snacking out of hand. D√∂kkt r√∫gbrau√∞, Iceland Alamy The simmering, geothermal heat that powers Iceland's geysers, hot springs and steam vents also provides a natural oven for this slow-baked Icelandic rye bread. Made with dark rye flour, the dough is enclosed in a metal pot before it's buried in the warm ground near geothermal springs and other hotspots. When baked in the traditional method, d√∂kkt r√∫gbrau√∞ takes a full 24 hours to cook in the subterranean ""oven."" It's an ingenious use of an explosive natural resource, and in the hot-springs town of Laugarvatn, visitors can try loaves of d√∂kkt r√∫gbrau√∞ when it's fresh from a hole in the black sand. Paratha, India Stuart Freedman/Corbis/Getty Images Flatbreads go wonderfully flaky in this whole-wheat Indian treat, which can be eaten plain or studded with savory fillings. Folding and rolling the dough over thinly spread fat creates sumptuous layers that are rich with flavor, employing a technique similar to that used for croissants or puff pastry. Stuffed wheat bread has been made in India for hundreds of years, and several varieties even get a shout-out in the ""Manasollasa,"" a 12th-century Sanskrit text that contains some of the earliest written descriptions of the region's food. Roti gambang, Indonesia Shutterstock Palm sugar and cinnamon lend a light, aromatic sweetness to roti gambang, a tender wheat bread that's an old-fashioned favorite at Jakarta bakeries. The name evokes the gambang, a traditional Indonesian instrument with a resemblance to the slender, brown loaves. For the recipe, though, cooks look back to the colonial era: From spiced holiday cookies to cheese sticks topped with Gouda or Edam, Indonesian baking has adapted Dutch ingredients and techniques to local tastes. Sangak, Iran Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images It takes a pair of deft bakers to craft this addictive Iranian flatbread, which is cooked directly on a bed of hot pebbles. That blazing-hot surface pocks the wheat dough with golden blisters, and it gives sangak -- also known as nan-e sangak -- a characteristic chewiness. If you're lucky enough to taste sangak hot from the oven, enjoy a heavenly contrast of crisp crust and tender crumb. Eat the flatbread on its own, or turn it into an Iranian-style breakfast: Use a piece of sangak to wrap salty cheese and a bundle of aromatic green herbs. Soda bread, Ireland Shutterstock You don't need yeast to get lofty bread: Chemical leavening can add air through an explosive combination of acidic and basic ingredients. While Native Americans used refined potash to leaven griddled breads -- an early example of chemical leavening -- this version became popular during the lean years of the Irish Potato Famine. With potato crops failing, impoverished Irish started mixing loaves using soft wheat flour, sour milk and baking soda. Now, dense loaves of soda bread are a nostalgic treat that's a perfect pairing with salted Irish butter. Challah, Israel Shutterstock If you think challah is limited to pillowy, braided loaves, think again -- traditionally, challah is any bread used in Jewish ritual. And Jewish bakers have long made breads as diverse as the diaspora itself: Think blistered flatbreads, hearty European loaves and Hungarian confections dotted with poppy seeds. Israel's modern-day bakers draw on that rich heritage. But on Friday afternoons in Tel Aviv, you'll still spot plenty of the classic Ashkenazi versions that many people in the United States know as challah. Those golden loaves are tender with eggs, and shiny under a generous glaze. It's the braid, though, that catches the eye. By wrapping dough strands together, bakers create twelve distinctive mounds said to represent twelve loaves in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem. Ciabatta, Italy Bruce Bisping/Star Tribune/Getty Images Between an emphasis on ""ancient grains"" and centuries of floury traditions, it can seem like breadmaking is stuck in the past. But bread is continually evolving, and there's no better example than this iconic Italian loaf, which was only invented in the 1980s. In 1982, Italian baker Arnaldo Cavallari created the low, chewy loaf in defiance of the baguette-style breads he saw taking over Roman bakeries. It was a watershed moment in the comeback of artisanal breads, which has roots in the 1960s and 1970s backlash against the increasingly industrialized food system. Bammy bread, Jamaica Shutterstock Pan-fried cassava cakes are delicious comfort food in Jamaica, where rounds of bammy bread are a hearty pairing for the island's ultra-fresh seafood. The traditional process for making bammy bread starts with processing grated cassava to get rid of naturally occurring cyanide; next, sifted cassava pulp is pressed into metal rings. It's a recipe with ancient roots -- cassava has been a staple in South America and the Caribbean since long before the arrival of Europeans here, and it's believed that the native Arawak people used the root to make flatbreads as well. Kare pan, Japan Shutterstock Yeasted wheat dough makes a convenient package for Japanese curry, turning a sit-down meal into a snack that can be eaten out of hand. Kare pan, or curry bread, is rolled in panko before a dunk in the deep fryer, ensuring a crispy crust that provides maximum textural contrast with the soft, saucy interior. Kare pan is so beloved that there's even a crime-fighting superhero named for the savory treat: A star of the anime series ""Soreike! Anpanman,"" Karepanman fights villains by shooting out a burning-hot curry filling. Taboon bread, Jordan Shutterstock Follow the aroma of baking bread in Amman, and you'll find bakers in roadside stalls stacking this classic flatbread into steaming piles. When shaping taboon, bakers press rounds of soft, wheat dough over a convex form, then slap them onto the interior of a conical clay oven. What emerges is a chewy round that's crackling with steam, wafting a rich smell of grain and smoke. It's the ideal foil for a plate of Jordanian mouttabal, a roasted eggplant dip that's blended with ground sesame seeds and yogurt. Roti canai, Malaysia Alamy Roti flatbread may have arrived in Malaysia with Indian immigrants, but the country's made the flaky, rich bread their own. When cooked on a hot griddle, roti canai puffs into a stack of overlapping layers rich with buttery flavor. Irresistible when served with Malaysian dips and curries, roti canai becomes a meal all its own with the addition of stuffings from sweet, ripe bananas to fried eggs. ƒ¶ob≈º tal-Malti, Malta Shutterstock The tawny crust of Malta's sourdough gives way to a pillow-soft interior, ideal for rubbing with a fresh tomato or soaking up the islands' prized olive oils. Classic versions take more than a day to prepare, and were traditionally baked in shared, wood-fired ovens that served as community gathering places. Even now that few Maltese bake their own bread, ƒ¶ob≈º tal-Malti has a powerful symbolism for the Mediterranean island nation. When trying to discover someone's true nature, a Maltese person might ask ""x'ƒßobz jiekol dan?,"" literally, ""what kind of bread does he eat?"" Tortillas, Mexico Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post/Getty Images Thin rounds of corn dough turn blistered and brown on a hot comal, the traditional griddles that have been used in Mexico since at least 700 B.C. Whether folded into a taco or eaten out of hand, corn tortillas are one of the country's most universally loved foods. The ground-corn dough is deceptively simple; made from just a few ingredients, it's nonetheless a triumph of culinary ingenuity. Before being ground, the corn is mixed with an alkaline ingredient such as lime, a process called nixtamalization that makes the grain more nutritious and easier to digest. Khobz kesra, Morocco Bartosz Luczak/iStockphoto/Getty Images Follow the rich scent of baking bread through a Moroccan medina, and you may find yourself at one of the communal neighborhood ovens called ferran. This is where locals bring rounds of tender wheat dough ready to bake into khobz kesra, one of the country's homiest breads. The low, rounded loaves have a slightly crisp exterior that earns them pride of place on the Moroccan table, where their fluffy texture is ideal for absorbing aromatic tajine sauce. Fry bread, Navajo Nation Luke E. Montavon/AFP/Getty Images Golden, crisp rounds of fry bread are a taste of home for many in the Navajo Nation, as well as a reminder of a tragic history. When Navajo people were forced out of their Arizona lands by the US government in 1864, they resettled in New Mexican landscapes where growing traditional crops of beans and vegetables proved difficult. To survive, they used government-provided stores of white flour, lard and sugar, creating fry bread out of stark necessity. Now, fry bread is a symbol of perseverance and tradition, and a favorite treat everywhere from powwows to family gatherings. Tijgerbrood, Netherlands Shutterstock Putting the ""Dutch"" in Dutch crunch, tijgerbrood is a crust-lover's masterpiece in every crispy bite. To create the mottled top of tijgerbrood, bakers spread unbaked loaves of white bread with a soft mixture of rice flour, sesame oil, water and yeast. Heat transforms the exterior into a crispy pattern of snackable pieces, and loaves of tijgerbrood are beloved for sandwiches. (An ocean away from Amsterdam's Old World bakeries, San Francisco has made Dutch crunch its sandwich bread of choice as well.) Rƒìwena parƒÅoa, New Zealand Shutterstock When European settlers brought potatoes and wheat to New Zealand, indigenous Maori people made the imported ingredients their own with this innovative bread. To mix the dough, potatoes are boiled then fermented into a sourdough-like starter that gives the finished bread a sweet-and-sour taste. Now, rƒìwena parƒÅoa is a favorite treat when layered with butter and jam or served with a hearty portion of raw fish, a longtime delicacy for Maori people. Lefse, Norway Shutterstock If you don't think of northern Europe as flatbread country, you haven't tasted lefse. The Norwegian potato flatbread is a favorite at holidays, when there are many hands to roll the soft dough with a grooved pin, then cook it on a hot griddle. For a taste of Norwegian comfort food, eat a warm lefse spiraled with butter, sugar and a dash of cinnamon. While potatoes are just an 18th-century addition to the Norwegian diet, Scandinavian flatbread is at least as old as the Vikings. Podplomyk, Poland Shutterstock Slather a hot round of podplomyk with white cheese and fruit preserves for a taste of old-fashioned, Polish home cooking. The unyeasted flatbread is blistered brown. With ingredients limited to wheat flour, salt and water, podplomyk is a deliciously simple entry in the sprawling family tree of flatbreads. Since dough for podplomyk is rolled thin, it was traditionally baked before other loaves are ready for the oven. In the Middle Ages, the portable breads were shared with neighbors and household members as a sign of friendship. (Today, that tradition is carried on with the exchange of oplatek wafers at Christmastime.) Broa de milho, Portugal Shutterstock Corn and buckwheat are stone-milled, sifted and kneaded in a wooden trough for the most traditional version of this hearty peasant bread from northern Portugal. When the loaves are baked in wood-fired, stone ovens, an archipelago of floury crust shards expands over deep cracks. The ovens themselves are sealed with bread dough, which acts as a natural oven timer: The bread is ready when the dough strips turn toasty brown. Europeans didn't taste corn until they arrived in the Americas, but it would be eagerly adopted in northern Portuguese regions where soil conditions are poorly suited to growing wheat. Karavai, Russia Shutterstock Bread baking becomes art on Russian holidays, when golden loaves of karavai are decked in dough flowers, animals and swirls. The bread plays a starring role at weddings, with elaborate rules to govern the baking process: Traditionally, a happily married woman must mix the dough, and a married man slides the round loaf into the oven. Even the round shape has an ancient symbolism and is thought to date back to ancient sun worship. Now, it's baked to ensure health and prosperity for a new couple. Pane carasau, Sardinia Shutterstock Once part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, this mountainous island's cuisine remains distinct from mainland Italy. Among the most iconic foods here is pane carasau, parchment-thin flatbread with a melodic nickname: carta de musica, or sheet music. While pane carasau starts like a classic flatbread, there's a Sardinian twist that makes it an ideal traveling companion; after the flatbreads puff up in the oven, they're sliced horizontally into two thinner pieces. Those pieces are baked a second time, drying out the bread enough to last for months. Proja, Serbia Shutterstock Warm squares of Serbian proja, or cornbread, are a favorite accompaniment to the country's lush meat stews. It's a homey dish that's often cooked fresh for family meals, then served hot from the oven. Ground corn offers a lightly sweet foil to salty toppings, from salty kajmak cheese to a scattering of cracklings. Gyeran-ppang, South Korea Shutterstock There's buried treasure within every loaf of gyeran-ppang, individually sized wheat breads with a whole egg baked inside. Translating simply to ""egg bread,"" gyeran-ppang is a favorite in the streets of Seoul, eaten hot for breakfast -- or at any other time of day. The addition of ham, cheese and chopped parsley adds a savory twist to the sweet-and-salty treat, a belly-warming snack that keeps South Korea fueled through the country's long winters. Appam, Sri Lanka Shutterstock A thin, fermented batter of rice flour and coconut milk turns crisp in the bowl-shaped pans used for cooking appam, one of Sri Lanka's most ubiquitous treats. Often called hoppers, this whisper-thin pancake is best eaten hot -- preferably while standing around a Colombo street food stall. Favorite toppings for appam in Sri Lanka include coconut sambal and chicken curry, or you can order one with egg. For egg hoppers, a whole egg is cracked into the center of an appam, then topped with a richly aromatic chili paste. Appam is also popular in southern India. Kisra, Sudan and South Sudan Alamy Overnight fermentation lends a delicious tang to this Sudanese flatbread, balancing the mild, earthy flavor of sorghum flour with a tart bite. Making the crepe-like kisra takes practice and patience, but perfect the art of cooking these on a flat metal pan and you'll be in for a classic Sudanese treat. Like Ethiopian injera, kisra is both staple food and an edible utensil -- use pieces of the spongy bread to scoop up spicy bites of the hearty stews that are some of Sudan's most beloved foods. Limpa bread, Sweden Alamy Before commercial yeast was available, brewers and bakers worked in tandem: Brewers harvested yeast from their batches of beer, passing it off to bakers whose bread would be infused with a light beer flavor. That legacy lives on in Sweden's v√∂rtlimpa: Limpa means loaf, while v√∂rt refers to a tart dose of brewer's wort. Known as limpa bread in English, the light rye now gets acidity from orange juice, not brewers wort. Balep korkun, Tibet Alamy Crops of cold-hardy barley have thrived on the Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years, and the grain has long been a staple of high-altitude diets there. While balep korkun is often made with wheat, traditional versions of this flatbread are shaped from tsampa, a roasted barley flour with nutty flavor. That rich-tasting flour is so central to Tibetan identity that it's been turned into a hashtag and been called out in rap songs . (The Dalai Lama even eats it for breakfast. ) Simit, Turkey VW Pics/UIG/Getty Images Dredged in sesame seeds and spiraled into rings, simit might be Turkey's ultimate on-the-go treat. A few decades ago, vendors wound through the Istanbul streets carrying trays piled high with the breads, but roving bread-sellers are now rare in the capital. Instead, commuters pick up their daily simit at roadside stands, where the deep-colored rings are stacked by the dozen. A burnished crust infuses the breads with a light sweetness -- before sliding into wood fired ovens, simit is dunked in sugar-water or thinned molasses, a slick glaze that turns to caramel in the intense heat. Crumpets, United Kingdom Shutterstock Yeasted wheat batter bubbles into a spongy cake for this griddled treat, a British favorite when smeared with jam, butter or clotted cream. Ring molds contain the pourable batter on an oiled griddle, which cooks one side of each crumpet to a golden hue. Like Eastern European zwieback and crisp rusks, crumpets are mostly eaten as a twice-baked bread -- the rounds are split and toasted before serving. Biscuits, United States Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post/Getty Images Smeared with butter or dripping in gravy, biscuits are one of the United States' homiest tastes. That's not to say they're easy to make: Achieving soft, fluffy biscuits requires quick hands and gentle mixing. In the antebellum South, biscuits were seen as a special treat for Sunday dinner. These days they're nearly ubiquitous, from gas station barbecue joints to home-cooked meals. Part of the secret is in the flour, typically a low-protein flour like White Lily. The soft wheat used for White Lily was long grown in Southern states -- before long-distance food shipping. (It's now milled in the Midwest.) Non, Uzbekistan Shutterstock Flatbreads become art in Uzbekistan's traditional tandoor ovens, which turn out rounds adorned with twists, swirls and stamps. Uzbek non varies across regions, from Tashkent's chewy versions to Samarkand loaves showered in black nigella seeds. As soon as the breads emerge from the oven, they're turned over to a swarm of bicycle messengers who ferry the hot loaves to markets and cafes. Arepa, Venezuela Shutterstock Areperos -- Venezuelan arepa-makers -- pat golden rounds of corn dough onto hot griddles to give the plump flatbreads a deliciously toasted crust and tender, steaming interior. Arepas have been made in Venezuela and surrounding regions since long before the arrival of Europeans in South America, and the nourishing corn breads can range from simple to elaborate. At breakfast, try them split and buttered. Stuffed with savory fillings, creamy sauces and fiery salsa, arepas can become a hearty meal all their own. Malawach, Yemen Shutterstock A family tree of flatbreads stretches across the Middle East and beyond, but Yemen's Jewish community's version is a richer treat than most. To make malawach, bakers roll wheat dough into a delicate sheet and fold it over a slick of melted butter.

5,Hong Kong,Liam Dann: Farmers riding to NZ's economic rescue ... again,"5 minutes to read But somewhat counter-intuitively, the trade war continues to play out well for our exporters. For all the noise and fears of a global economic slowdown, New Zealand exports to China rose 23 per cent in the year to September according to StatsNZ data out last week. Advertisement New Zealand's total exports rose $216 million (5.1 per cent) from September 2018 to $4.5 billion, according to the latest terms of trade data from Stats NZ. Dairy and meat (boosted by high demand after China's swine flu epidemic) have both led the way. Perhaps you could say that New Zealand got lucky with the way the trade stoush has played out. But then New Zealand seems to get lucky on commodity exports with a fairly predictable regularity. We're geographically lucky. We have water and land and we grow grass well. We've built an economy around utilising those strengths efficiently. The IMF, which last week downgraded its growth outlook for the Asian region, now has New Zealand clearly at the head of their pack next year. In its Regional Economic Outlook, the IMF said growth in Asia could moderate to 5 per cent in 2019, and 5.1 per cent in 2020. When you look at just the advanced economies in the region, New Zealand is now solidly the best performer and expected to remain that way next year. The IMF has our GDP growth rate at 2.5 per cent for this year and 2.7 per cent next. That might be slightly more optimistic than many local economists but then the IMF's cheery outlook (subject to three downward revisions already this year) also applies to the other economies it measures. It currently has Australia as next best economy (1.7 per cent growth this year and 2.3 per cent next) and South Korea third (2 per cent and 2.2 per cent). Despite big downward revisions for Singapore and Hong Kong, Japan remains the slowest - with forecast growth of just 0.5 per cent. The IMF data also shows New Zealand winning the race to the bottom on central bank rate cuts this year. The Reserve Bank has already shaved 0.75 per cent off the official cash rate this year. There has been some concern that Reserve Bank's double interest rate cut (50 basis points) in August might have backfired by further rocking business confidence. But the strategy has paid off with a timely fall the value of the Kiwi dollar. At around US64c, it is now trading much lower than the levels our commodity prices would normally warrant. The expectations of higher agricultural returns won't provide an instant panacea for our domestic woes. The economy will likely continue to slow for some months and coupled with low inflation that's likely to mean at least one, possible two more rate cuts. That should keep downward pressure on the currency for at least the next dairy season. Unless we cop a nasty drought (and soil moisture levels around the country are currently very good) things look promising for a regionally led economic recovery. By the standards of many economic commentators (including me occasionally) this is not all good. It is a reminder that New Zealand's economy remains more or less adrift on a turbulent sea of commodity markets that we can not control. Experts can also give you plenty of reasons why the long-term direction for international trade is worrying for New Zealand. Tiwai Smelter. Photo / Supplied We are getting a taste of trade war downside in the growing concerns about the future of Tiwai Point aluminium smelter. Global manufacturing output has been hit much harder than food production and that's not been good news for metals demand. Aluminium prices have slumped and we're back debating whether to further subsidise Aussie mining giant Rio Tinto to save 1000 Southland jobs. Perhaps we should be thankful we're not more reliant on hard commodities.

6,Hong Kong,Protesters block roads during illegal march in Hong Kong with Kowloon Mosque and Chungking Mansions on high alert | South China Morning Post,"\n At least 14 MTR stations closed as protesters taking part in illegal march leave trail of destruction through Kowloon \n Journeys on high-speed rail link disrupted while demonstrators strike again on usual targets of vandalism \n Chaos started with illegal march which later descended into violence and fires lit in Mong Kok, as mobs targeted stores with mainland links. An illegal march in Hong Kong has turned into another night of violence and wanton destruction in the city as protesters course down the major thoroughfare of Nathan Road, smashing up and burning MTR stations and shops with mainland Chinese links. A huge blaze engulfed a Xiaomi store in Mong Kok, while earlier petrol bombs were thrown into the exits of at least two MTR stations. Several other shops and restaurants, including branches of Best Mart 360 and Yoshinoya have been targeted. In response, police have deployed water cannon firing blue dye, a bomb disposal robot and rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets. Our blog below captured events as they unfolded.

7,Hong Kong,Trump's worst month in office was one of Mike Pence's best,"October has been one of President Donald Trump's worst months in office -- and one of Mike Pence's best.
As a series of damaging revelations in the House impeachment inquiry weighed on Trump, the vice president was thrust into the spotlight twice as the point-man on major policy issues. They were fraught with political risk, but resulted in the biggest wins of Pence's tenure.
In the span of two weeks, Pence salvaged a tenuous and short-term peace between Turkey and Kurdish forces, quelling an uproar in Washington after Republicans blasted Trump's withdrawal in Syria. A week later, the vice president rebuked Beijing's record on human rights -- in a speech long-sought by both Republicans and Democrats -- without disrupting fragile U.S.-China trade talks.
The performances suggest the White House may increasingly turn to the vice president to handle politically thorny situations as a parade of impeachment witnesses further weaken Trump's ability to get anything done in Washington. In October, the number of Americans supporting the House inquiry grew to more than half, according to a RealClearPolitics average of public polling.
Trump reclaimed the limelight over the weekend with an announcement that U.S. troops had killed the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The foreign policy victory offered Trump a reprieve from a flood of impeachment-related news, but it's likely to be brief.
Pence has also almost single-handedly led efforts to pressure House Democrats to vote for Trump's rewrite of NAFTA -- likely the only major Trump initiative that stands a chance of passing Congress before the 2020 elections. The vice president has been criss-crossing the U.S. to sell the deal -- traveling last week to key swing states Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and this week to Virginia.
He's also stumping for GOP gubernatorial candidates in Louisiana and Kentucky this week and will headline a fundraising event in Texas for Trump's re-election campaign.
Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist, said Pence is a popular visitor for GOP officeholders across the country.
""There are not a lot of places he can't go. He can appeal to all segments of the party, whether it's the MAGA crowd or the more establishment lane,"" Gorman said. ""And the most important part is that he is relentlessly on message. He's not going to make news on anyone other than who he's there to support.""
Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, dismissed the notion that Pence is filling a leadership void created by the impeachment inquiry. The vice president is relentlessly deferential to his boss, known in Washington for heaping praise on Trump at public events.
But Short said there is a benefit to Pence's focus on core issues in his appearances.
""In the midst of a conversation about impeachment, the vice president is showing the hard work that is being done by this administration on behalf of the American people,"" Short said.
Still, Pence is politically anchored to Trump and has his own troublesome connections to the impeachment inquiry, which is centered on whether Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump drew Pence into the inquiry during a Sept. 25 news conference, telling reporters they should ask for the vice president's communications with Zelenskiy because the records would show their discussions were ""perfect."" Pence, who met with Zelenskiy on Sept. 1 in Warsaw, has said he doesn't object to releasing accounts of his communications.
William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, testified last week that Zelenskiy had asked Pence directly about about security assistance that had been frozen during their Warsaw meeting. Pence didn't answer definitively but said that Trump wanted European countries to do more to support Ukraine and for Kyiv to more aggressively probe corruption, according to Taylor. Pence has denied raising the topic of Biden with Ukraine's leader.
Within the White House, there are concerns about precedent and executive privilege that are holding up a final decision to release records of Pence's interactions with Zelenkskiy to the public, according to a senior administration official. NBC News reported earlier on Tuesday that some of Trump's allies are concerned that records of Pence's communications with Zelenskiy could make the president's own interactions with the Ukrainian leader look even worse.
The vice president's October wins helped distract from the impeachment drama playing out in Washington. He announced the cease-fire agreement with Turkey on Oct. 17, the same day acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney held a news conference in which he acknowledged that Trump sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine, only to reverse himself later.
Roughly an hour after Mulvaney's appearance began, Pence took the lectern at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Ankara to announce he had reached a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
""I spoke to President Trump just a few moments ago, and I know the president is very grateful for President Erdogan's willingness to step forward and to enact the cease-fire, and to give an opportunity for a peaceful solution of this conflict,"" he said.
Some on Pence's staff initially had misgivings about the trip because it put the vice president into an uncertain situation -- Erdogan had indicated beforehand that he would not agree to a cease-fire. But the deal, which was panned by lawmakers from both parties as a giveaway to Turkey, was seen as a success within the White House, and others have warmed to it as the peace has held.
Trump declared the cease-fire ""permanent"" on Oct. 23 and said that he would lift sanctions on Turkey. He thanked Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for ""leading the American delegation so successfully"" and brokering a deal that saved ""countless lives"" without ""spilling one drop of American blood.""
Being in the limelight carries risks in Trump's White House. The president is known to grow weary of people around him who attract too much attention. And there's also the possibility of being undercut by the commander-in-chief.
On Thursday in his China speech, Pence went further than the president has in criticizing Beijing's human rights record, including its intervention to end protests in Hong Kong -- an attempt to ""curtail the rights and liberties of its people,"" the vice president said. China's leaders fired back, criticizing what they called Pence's ""arrogance.""
Trump called Pence's China speech ""fine"" four times when asked about it on Friday, stopping short of a full-throated endorsement.
""I'm also working very closely with China on a deal, but his speech was fine,"" Trump said.
The president said he reviewed the speech with Pence before the vice president delivered it and Short said the two men are ""in frequent communication"" over messaging. The China speech was ""no different,"" he said.

8,Hong Kong,Garena Will Not Have Publishing Rights for Riot‚Äôs New Games,"League of Legends Garena Will Not Have Publishing Rights for Riot‚Äôs New Games The Singapore-based digital services company, however, will continue to be the Southeast Asian distributor for League of Legends. + By Addil Bin Bashir 12:13 p.m.
We spoke to Riot Games executives in Singapore recently and we have official confirmation that Garena will not have publishing rights for Riot‚Äôs new and upcoming games . Riot Games' General Manager for SEA, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Justin Hulog, and Head of Growth and Launch, Jennifer Poulson.
Riot Games‚Äô General Manager for Southeast Asia, Hong and Taiwan, Justin Hulog, said although Garena played a pivotal role in expanding the League of Legends brand in the Southeast Asian region, the company faced a difficult job servicing the community ‚Äúin a way that made sense for their business‚Äù.
‚ÄúMoving forward, Garena will still publish LoL but we (Riot) will self-publish where it‚Äôs possible for our new games.
‚ÄúWe want to make sure players are heard and have direct conversations with them. For the new games, we are building a team here (in Singapore), holding events and distributing games directly as part of efforts to align with the ecosystem,‚Äù he said.
Hulog said the biggest goal Riot Games had yet to achieve was the ability to deliver games directly to its customers.
‚ÄúWe want to have conversations and serve the community directly. We‚Äôre looking for the brightest minds to serve the market more effectively.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a market we care about. It is important to develop ways to listen and talk to players and give feedback to developers to make changes. The first priority is building the Singapore team and office.‚Äù
Hulog made it clear that players of Riot‚Äôs upcoming games do not have to post their comments and feedback on a designated forum.
‚ÄúRather, we are following all the channels used by players, including Reddit and Facebook. Instead of forcing players into a specific forum, we will build teams to go into these places of conversation. The conversation only matters if we can help change things.‚Äù In This Article Release Date: Oct. 27, 2009 Platforms: Macintosh, Pc, Pc",2019-10-17T07:13:00.000+03:00,ign.com,league|*|legends|*|garena|*|publishing|*|rights|*|riot|*|new|*|games|*|singapore|*|base|*|digital|*|service|*|company|*|continue|*|southeast|*|asian|*|distributor|*|league|*|legends|*|addil|*|bin|*|bashir|*|-pron-|*|speak|*|riot|*|games|*|executive|*|singapore|*|recently|*|-pron-|*|official|*|confirmation|*|garena|*|publish|*|right|*|riot|*|new|*|upcoming|*|game|*|riot|*|games|*|general|*|manager|*|sea|*|hong_kong|*|taiwan|*|justin|*|hulog|*|head|*|growth|*|launch|*|jennifer|*|poulson|*|riot|*|games|*|general|*|manager|*|southeast|*|asia|*|hong|*|taiwan|*|justin|*|hulog|*|garena|*|play|*|pivotal|*|role|*|expand|*|league|*|legends|*|brand|*|southeast|*|asian|*|region|*|company|*|face|*|difficult|*|job|*|service|*|community|*|way|*|sense|*|-pron-|*|business|*|forward|*|garena|*|publish|*|lol|*|-pron-|*|riot|*|self|*|publish|*|-pron-|*|possible|*|-pron-|*|new|*|game|*|-pron-|*|want|*|sure|*|player|*|hear|*|direct|*|conversation|*|-pron-|*|new|*|game|*|-pron-|*|build|*|team|*|singapore|*|hold|*|event|*|distribute|*|game|*|directly|*|effort|*|align|*|ecosystem|*|-pron-|*|hulog|*|big|*|goal|*|riot|*|games|*|achieve|*|ability|*|deliver|*|game|*|directly|*|-pron-|*|customer|*|-pron-|*|want|*|conversation|*|serve|*|community|*|directly|*|-pron-|*|look|*|bright|*|mind|*|serve|*|market|*|effectively|*|-pron-|*|market|*|-pron-|*|care|*|-pron-|*|important|*|develop|*|way|*|listen|*|talk|*|player|*|feedback|*|developer|*|change|*|priority|*|build|*|singapore|*|team|*|office|*|hulog|*|-pron-|*|clear|*|player|*|riot|*|upcoming|*|game|*|post|*|-pron-|*|comment|*|feedback|*|designate|*|forum|*|-pron-|*|follow|*|channel|*|use|*|player|*|include|*|reddit|*|facebook|*|instead|*|force|*|player|*|specific|*|forum|*|-pron-|*|build|*|team|*|place|*|conversation|*|conversation|*|matter|*|-pron-|*|help|*|change|*|thing|*|article|*|release|*|date|*|platforms|*|macintosh|*|pc|*|pc

11,Hong Kong,Hong Kong police officer shoots protester with live round in early morning clashes - CNN,"Hong Kong (CNN) A man has been set on fire in Hong Kong only hours after a protester was shot by police with a live round, as the city experiences one of the most dramatic days in over five months of protests.
Protesters began disrupting transit as early as 7 a.m. local time as part of a day-long general strike, and clashed with police in several locations. In Sai Wan Ho, on eastern Hong Kong Island, a traffic police officer shot a 21-year-old protester in the torso. The protester was in a critical condition on Monday morning, but by the afternoon, police said there was no immediate threat to his life. The shooting sparked public outrage, escalating what had already looked to be a long day of demonstrations. In a separate incident, a man who confronted a group of pro-democracy protesters was doused in a flammable liquid and set alight, according to a graphic video seen by CNN and widely shared on social media. The video shows an unidentified and unarmed man shouting expletives at protesters before saying ""you're all not Chinese."" The man is in hospital in a critical condition, the city's Hospital Authority told CNN. A Hong Kong police source said that they are investigating the incident which took place on Monday at the Ma On Shan subway station in the New Territories.

Hide Caption 159 of 159 Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violent scenes, which injured 60 people, during a press conference on Monday evening. She said the escalating unrest was bringing Hong Kong ""to the brink of no return"" and the government would not yield to protestors demands. ""If there is any wishful thinking that by escalating violence the (Hong Kong) government will yield to pressure to satisfy protesters' so-called demands, I'm making this clear that will not happen,"" she said. The day saw protesters hurl petrol bombs, set fires, build barricades and disrupt transit in several locations, including the crucial cross-harbor tunnel that connects Hong Kong Island with Kowloon. In total, demonstrators vandalized or blocked roads in over 120 locations around the city, police said at a press conference on Monday afternoon. ""We appeal to everyone to please stay calm and rational,"" Tse Chun-Chung, Hong Kong Chief Superintendent of Police, said. ""Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong -- everyone is a loser."" Tse said a police officer has been suspended from front line service after driving a motorbike through a crowd of protesters in Kwai Fung, in the New Territories. But he said that while his officers were under great pressure, they were not out of control. Office workers in the city's Central financial district have been sent home as riot police fired tear gas to disperse protesters. Video footage from the ground shows people rushing into a subway station to escape the gas, and a massive crowd chanting ""murder"" as they march past luxury fashion shops. Several subway lines experienced minor to severe delays, with some stations closed and routes partially suspended ""due to an escalation of the situation in stations,"" according to the MTR subway operator. At least five universities have closed and canceled classes on Monday. Protester shot Monday's shooting occurred as police attempted to disperse protesters who had blocked roads in Sai Wan Ho, Tse said. According to Tse, an officer was arresting a protester when another protester ran towards him. The officer pulled his gun, and then shot it, as he believed the protester would attempt to snatch his gun which could result in ""death and casualties,"" Tse said. A video clip of the shooting shared online shows the traffic officer grappling with a protester. A second protester, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, approaches the scuffle, and the officer raises his gun. The second protester appears to try and wave or slap the gun away, and the officer shoots him at close range, to screams from the surrounding crowd of protesters and passersby. Several more protesters then grapple with the officer, and two more live rounds are fired off-camera. Police officers have since cordoned off the area where the protester was shot. In a statement , police responded to ""online rumors"" of reckless firearm use, calling the accusations ""totally false and malicious."" ""Police (have) strict guidelines and orders regarding the use of firearms,"" the statement said. ""All police officers are required to justify their enforcement actions."" Protesters throw bricks in Wong Tai Sin district on November 11. Five months of protests The anti-government protests, which began in June in opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have dragged on for five months . The bill's withdrawal satisfied just one of the protesters' five major demands, which include an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and wider democratic reforms. In response to the demands, the government appointed a panel of overseas experts to assist Hong Kong's longstanding Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), which is conducting a fact-finding study into alleged police misconduct during the protests. People run into a mall after police fired tear gas in the Central district of Hong Kong on November 11. But on Saturday, one of the experts tweeted a copy of the panel's progress report, criticizing the IPCC's investigative capabilities, and saying it needed to ""substantially enhance its capacity"" to assess evidence from witnesses and assemble a coherent account of the facts. The IPCC said it was ""disappointed"" that it was not consulted before one of the overseas experts made the progress report public. On Sunday, the Hong Kong government said the IPCC's study would be ""by no means a final report."" The nonstop protests have also sent retail and tourism numbers plunging, and the semi-autonomous city fell into recession in October. Travel is dropping as demonstrations escalate in violence , and there is increasing public hostility toward the city government and police force. This isn't the first time a protester has been shot -- police first used lethal force in October by firing a live shot and injuring an 18-year-old man.

Xi Jinping's message to Hong Kong: Get used to Carrie Lam 02:14 But things kicked up a notch on the weekend, with raging protests fueled by anger over the death of a 22-year-old student . Chow Tsz-lok, a computer sciences student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), died on Friday morning, days after falling and suffering a severe head injury in a parking garage close to the scene of protests. Chow had been in a coma and on life support until Friday. There is no indication that Chow was involved in the nearby protest the night of his injury. Protesters and fellow students mourned his death throughout the weekend, with a vigil on Friday night and a memorial on Sunday. HKUST students left flowers and messages on Post-it notes on campus, and vigil attendees laid flowers and lit candles. Hong Kong student dies after fall in a parking garage during weekend protests Chow's death also prompted an outpouring of anger from anti-government protesters, who claim that police actions on the night of the accident resulted in paramedics being temporarily unable to access him. This anger spilled out during the weekend protests, with protesters on the streets shouting for ""revenge."" Police expressed ""profound sadness"" over Chow's death, but have strenuously denied responsibility and maintained that at no point did officers obstruct ambulance or fire services from assisting him. A police statement released on November 5 described the allegations as ""certainly false.""

12,Hong Kong,"Hong Kong to enter recession after protests damage retail, tourism - Business Insider","Hong Kong has been rocked by increasingly violent protests over the past four months. Anthony Kwan/Getty Images Hong Kong is set to enter a recession after protests rocked the city, causing retail sales to plummet and tourists to avoid visiting. Third-quarter figures due to be released on Thursday are expected to record a second consecutive negative economic growth for the city, which is a technical recession, officials said. Hong Kong Finance Secretary Paul Chan tied the economic downturn to the protests, saying the city's retailers, restaurants, and tourism industry had been ""shaken"" by the demonstrations. Visit Business Insider for more stories.
Hong Kong is set to enter a recession this week after protests destroyed retailers and brought the city's booming tourist industry to its knees.
Demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese city erupted in June over a proposed extradition bill, but have since evolved to include demands for greater democratic freedoms .
Retailers and local businesses have taken a huge hit as a result of the increasingly violent protests , and the number of tourists into the city has fallen dramatically.
Third-quarter growth numbers, due to be released on Thursday, are expected to show a second consecutive quarter of negative growth for the city's economy, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Finance Secretary Paul Chan separately warned this week.
A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks to reporters in the city in June 2019. Kin Cheung/AP
Chan attributed the poor growth figures to the ongoing protests in a speech last Tuesday .
""The continuing social unrest has shaken the retail trade, restaurants, tourism and other industries, exacerbating an already-weak economy,"" he said.
The city's tourism and retail industries have taken a particularly bad hit, he added in a Sunday blog post , noting that: The number of visitors into Hong Kong plunged in the first half of October 2019. Average hotel occupancy rates have also fallen in the same period. The total sales volume among retailers decreased by 25.3% in August, compared to last year, becoming the steepest year-on-year decline for a single month on record.

""The tourism sector said that the situation is now the worst since the [SARS] outbreak in 2003,"" Chan added, referring to the deadly virus that infected and shut down the city.
The figures are particularly stark given the fact that Hong Kong was the world's most-visited city last year, having seen in 30 million tourists, according to Euromonitor International .
Protesters shut down Hong Kong International Airport for several days in August, causing many airlines to cancel their flights.
Retailers from global luxury brands to small businesses have also suffered losses because protests have forced them to close early to protect their staff. A demonstration in Hong Kong International Airport in August 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu
In his blog post, Chan also detailed a set of ""supporting measures"" to tackle the growth issues facing the city, including handing out cash incentives to travel agents who manage to bring in tourists. He did not say when these measures would come into force.
Earlier this month Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, also pledged to donate 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($127 million) to help local businesses suffering losses as a result of the protests.
The Hong Kong government withdrew the extradition bill that sparked the protests in September, but demonstrations have continued and become increasingly violent as police and protesters exchange rubber bullets , tear gas , Molotov cocktails , and acid .

13,Hong Kong,China perfected vegetable-based 'fake meat' long before Impossible Burgers | CNN Travel,"Beijing (CNN) ‚Äî When 29-year-old Wang Jianguang was growing up in a poor neighborhood in China's northern Shanxi province, his family would buy him chicken wings with soy sauce as a rare treat. Except they weren't actually made of chicken. The wings were an intricate combination of soybeans and peanuts. ""They looked just like chicken wings, though,"" Wang said. It was his first encounter with China's centuries-old tradition of imitation meat dishes. A vegetarian sweet and sour ""pork"" dish at Green Veggie restaurant in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong. Paul Yeung/South China Morning Post/Getty Images Possible before Impossible In the past few years, demand for fake meat products has surged in the Western world, as people seek environmentally sustainable and healthier alternatives to red meat. Two of the biggest US plant-based food companies, ""Impossible Foods"" and ""Beyond Meat,"" have made millions from a growing appetite for meat-free burgers. By mid-2019, there were so many orders for ""Impossible Meat"" the company admitted it was struggling to keep up . But long before the first plant-based patties hit the grill in the West, China had been sculpting and flavoring traditional meat-based dishes out of mushrooms, nuts and vegetables. Related content Regional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying ""It shadows and parallels Chinese cuisine ... it is incredibly diverse and in every part of the country you have a different version,"" said food writer Fuschia Dunlop. Some records of monks eating tofu-based ""vegetarian meat"" date back as early as the Song Dynasty in the 10th century. It was known as ""fanghun cai"" or literally ""imitation meat dish."" Wang now works at a restaurant called Baihe Vegetarian in the traditional hutong alleyways of Beijing's Dongcheng district. They serve a huge range of fake meat dishes -- pork spare ribs, dumplings, kung pao chicken. The restaurant's owner Liu Hongyan said between 80 and 100 people regularly visit her restaurant each day and the number is rising. ""I think more and more people are embracing vegetarian culture. People are considering their health,"" she said. ""There's too much fat and oil in red meat,"" she said. Perfect imitation China's early adoption of fake meat products is closely linked to its long history of Buddhism. Buddhism was introduced to China as early as the Han Dynasty , around 2,000 years ago. Over the centuries, its popularity has risen and fallen in line with the preferences of the country's leaders. Today, it's practiced by around 20% of China's population -- some 250 million people. A central tenet of Buddhism is respect for all living creatures, and vegetarianism is common among its followers. Dunlop said that while China's monasteries provided a strict vegetarian diet, they would often have to accommodate for the dietary choices of visiting pilgrims or patrons. Related content The best cities for vegans around the world ""[The visitors] would expect [meat-based] meals and this was where the tradition came from. You'd get all the dishes you'd expect to eat at a banquet, but made from vegetarian ingredients."" Chinese Buddhist vegetarian food became ""extraordinarily sophisticated"" in the centuries after the Han Dynasty, according to Dunlop. ""In the larger monasteries ... people could dine on grand dishes of ""shark's fin,"" ""abalone"" and other delicacies cunningly fashioned from vegetable ingredients,"" Dunlop wrote in her book ""Food of Sichuan."" A Chinese ""fish"" dish made from vegetarian ingredients, including a faux fish skin. Alamy Today, she said the widespread influence of imitation meat can be seen in the range of dishes offered. In Shanghai, you can eat stir-fried ""crabmeat"" made from mashed potato and carrot. In Sichuan, restaurants offer traditional ""twice-cooked pork"" made without a scrap of meat. ""Everyone in Shanghai eats vegetarian ""roast duck"" or ""goose,"" which is made from layers of thin tofu skin, which are flavored and then deep fried so that it has a golden skin like the real dish,"" Dunlop said. Related content Which country has the best food? There are now more than 300 restaurants offering fake meat in Beijing alone, according to China Daily. But China is far from being a nation of vegetarians -- meat consumption is still huge. In the past 60 years, demand for pork has led to a 10-fold jump in the number of pigs slaughtered per person. As Chinese people have become richer, the demand for meat has risen at the same time. But even that rise in meat consumption may have helped push people towards vegetarian imitations. As recently as 2014, problems with tainted meat were being discovered in the country's largest food processing centers. ""Some people are quite worried about the source of the meat, but don't want to lose that taste,"" Dunlop explained. Peanuts, lotus and yam Wang takes great pride in creating his wide range of fake meat dishes at Baihe Restaurant. In his kitchen, he carefully shapes a single, large king oyster mushroom into small cubes which will soon become vegetarian ""kung pao chicken."" Adding flour, oil, cashews and sugar, among other ingredients, the mixture is tossed into a boiling hot wok. The final piping-hot product has the signature sweet-but-savory taste, with a consistency similar to the meat it's intended to mimic. According to Wang, in recent years industrialization has meant much of China's fake meat comes from factories rather than being made in kitchens. He makes all his dishes by hand. Related content Chinese food in India -- a fiery fusion of flavors ""For example, for pork ribs, the bone is made from lotus root, while the meat is made from potato, mushrooms and peanut protein,"" Wang said. He said the ribs need to sit overnight before they're ready to be served. While both Wang and owner Liu are aware of Western fashions in fake meat, they're both dismissive of the trend. For them, the original Chinese version is more sophisticated. ""Chinese vegetarian food is more complicated than the Western version. It has more forms, more tastes. The Western version is simple,"" Wang said. ""I feel like Westerners only eat burgers and steaks."" A year of the world's Best Beaches There's a perfect beach for every week of the year.

14,Hong Kong,EarthLink - News,"Security firm says Chinese hackers intercepted text messages
By TAMI ABDOLLAH | Thu, October 31, 2019 10:35 EDT
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Chinese hackers with a history of state-sponsored espionage have intercepted the text messages of thousands of foreigners in a targeted campaign that planted eavesdropping software on a telecommunications provider's servers, a cybersecurity firm said.
FireEye said in a report issued on Thursday that the hackers belong to the group designated Advanced Persistent Threat 41 , or APT41, which it says has been involved in spying and cybercrime for most of the past decade. It said some of the targets were ""high-value"" and all were chosen by their phone numbers and unique cellphone identifiers known as IMSI numbers.
The cybersecurity firm would not identify or otherwise characterize the victims or the impacted telecoms provider or give its location. It said only that the telecom is in a country that's typically a strategic competitor to China.
The spyware was programmed to capture messages containing references to political leaders, military and intelligence organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government, FireEye said.
FireEye's director of advanced practices, Steven Stone, said that none of the known targets was a U.S. government official.
The discovered malware, which FireEye dubbed MESSAGETAP, was able to collect data on its targets without their knowledge but could not read messages sent with end-to-end encrypted applications such as WhatsApp and iMessage.
""If you're one of these targets you have no idea your message traffic is being taken from your device because your device hasn't been infected,"" Stone said.
FireEye said the hackers also stole detailed calling records on specific individuals, obtaining the phone numbers they interacted with, call durations and times.
A government representative at China's embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
FireEye did not identify the maker of the equipment that was hacked or specify how the hackers penetrated the telecom provider networks.
It said APT41 began using MESSAGETAP during the summer, which is around when pro-democracy protests began in Hong Kong. The firm said since its discovery, it has found ""multiple"" telecoms targeted by the malware.
FireEye said it has observed APT41 targeting four telecoms this year as well as major travel services and healthcare providers in countries it did not identify.
Details of the espionage operation come as the U.S. tries to persuade allied governments to shun Chinese telecom equipment providers led by Huawei as they build next-generation wireless networks known as 5G, claiming they represent a risk to national security.
The U.S. government already has banned government agencies and contractors from using equipment supplied by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company. It is now seeking to bar their use in telecom projects that receive federal funding.
Huawei vehemently denies that it has allowed China's communist rulers to use its equipment for espionage, and Washington has presented no proof of such. U.S. officials say a 2017 Chinese law requires organizations and citizens to help the state collect intelligence.

15,Hong Kong,Chinese government blocks export of black clothing to Hong Kong,"Chinese government blocks export of black clothing to Hong Kong Save Save Among the banned items are black shirts and other clothing, helmets, umbrellas, walkie-talkies, drones, goggles, metal chains, safety vests and torches Credit: ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP Asia
C hina is reportedly curbing exports of black clothes from the mainland to Hong Kong in an effort to hamper anti-government protests which have rocked the global financial hub for more than four months.
Protesters have adopted plain black tops, jeans, trainers and face masks as their defacto uniform during rallies that began in opposition to a controversial extradition bill but have now snowballed into wider demands for democratic rights.
According to the South China Morning Post, a notice published on September 26 by the EXPRESS courier service in Guangdong, a coastal province close to Hong Kong, contained a long list of items that could not be delivered to the special administrative region.
Among the banned items are black shirts and other clothing, helmets, umbrellas, walkie-talkies, drones, goggles, metal chains, safety vests and torches.
In July, another notice by Guangdong courier company PHXBUY put a halt on similar goods, including flags, flagpoles and banners.
Yellow helmets, face masks and plastic eye goggles have become key equipment during the demonstrations as protesters seek to protect themselves from tear gas and rubber bullets fired by riot police. Umbrellas have been used as shields against dyed water being shot from cannons.
Couriers have warned that ‚Äúcustomers mailing products have to use their real names‚Äù and that ‚Äúthorough investigation‚Äù will be launched if any of the forbidden items are discovered.
A shopper on online retail platform Shopify recently asked if ""anyone else is having trouble shipping 'black' clothing items to Hong Kong from China? For those who don't know, China has put out an official [Public Service Announcement] to all courier services to stop picking up any clothing items that are considered black or even navy blue for an undisclosed amount of time.‚Äù
The move, already being mocked on social media, is part of a number of measures that Beijing has taken to squeeze the protest movement. Previously it pressured Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong‚Äôs flagship airline, to prevent staff who had supported the protests from flying on Chinese routes.
Meanwhile, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong‚Äôs Chief Executive, used emergency powers to ban the wearing of facemasks at public gatherings, a move widely flouted across the city.

16,Hong Kong,Do today's global protests have anything in common? - BBC News,"Do today's global protests have anything in common? 22 October 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP/Getty/Reuters Image caption Protests have been taking place in Chile, Hong Kong and Lebanon In recent weeks, mass protests have broken out in countries from Lebanon to Spain to Chile. All are different - with distinct causes, methods and goals - but there are some common themes that connect them.
While thousands of miles apart, protests have begun for similar reasons in several countries, and some have taken inspiration from each other on how to organise and advance their goals.
Here's a look at the issues at stake - and what binds many of those taking to the streets. Inequality
Many of those protesting are people who have long felt shut out of the wealth of their country. In several cases, a rise in prices for key services has proved the final straw.
Demonstrations began in Ecuador this month when the government announced that it was scrapping decades-old fuel subsidies as part of public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit.

Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end.
A hike in transport prices has also sparked protests in Chile. The government blamed higher energy costs and a weaker currency for its decision to increase bus and metro fares, but protesters said it was just the latest measure to squeeze the poor. Protests around the world in pictures
As demonstrators clashed with security forces on Friday evening, President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era was pictured dining in an upmarket Italian restaurant - a sign, some said, of the chasm between Chile's political elite and the people on the streets.
Chile is one of Latin America's wealthiest countries but also one of its most unequal - it has the worst levels of income equality among the 36 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Like in Ecuador, the government backtracked and suspended its fare hike in an effort to quell the protests. But the protests continued, growing to take in wider grievances.
""This is not a simple protest over the rise of metro fares, this is an outpouring for years of oppression that have hit mainly the poorest,"" one student taking part in the action told Reuters news agency.
Lebanon has seen similar unrest , with plans to tax WhatsApp calls prompting wider protests about economic problems, inequality and corruption. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protesters in Lebanon have been complained of inequality and corruption
With debt levels soaring, the government has been trying to implement economic reforms to secure a major aid package from international donors. But many ordinary people say they are suffering under the country's economic policies and that government mismanagement is to blame for their troubles.
""We are not here over the WhatsApp, we are here over everything: over fuel, food, bread, over everything,"" said Abdullah, a protester in Beirut. Corruption
Claims of government corruption are at the heart of several of the protests, and are closely linked to the issue of inequality.
In Lebanon, protesters argue that while they are suffering under an economic crisis, the country's leaders have been using their positions of power to enrich themselves, through kickbacks and favourable deals.
""I've seen a lot of things here but I have never seen such a corrupt government in Lebanon,"" said 50-year-old protester Rabab.
The government on Monday approved a package of reforms, including slashing politicians' salaries, in an effort to quell the unrest.
People in Iraq have also been calling for the end of a political system that they say has failed them. One of the main points of contention there is the way government appointments are made on the basis of sectarian or ethnic quotas, instead of on merit.
Demonstrators argue that this has allowed leaders to abuse public funds to reward themselves and their followers, with very little benefit to most citizens. Image copyright EPA Image caption Iraqi protesters say the political system is corrupt
Protests against alleged government corruption have also taken place in Egypt. The rare demonstrations in September were prompted by a call from Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman living in self-imposed exile in Spain, who accused President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the military of corruption.
His allegations that Mr Sisi and his government have been mishandling funds resonated with many Egyptians who have grown increasingly disaffected by austerity measures. Political freedom
In some countries, protesters are angered by political systems in which they feel trapped.
Demonstrations in Hong Kong began this summer over a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China in certain circumstances. Hong Kong is part of China but its people enjoy special freedoms and there is a deep sense of fear that Beijing wants to exert greater control.
Like fellow protesters in Chile and Lebanon, the mass action in Hong Kong led to the withdrawal of the controversial legislation, but the protests themselves continued. Among their demands, protesters now want complete universal suffrage, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality and amnesty for demonstrators who have been arrested.
Their tactics have inspired political activists halfway across the world. Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied in Barcelona to express anger over the jailing of Catalan separatist leaders. The separatists were convicted on 14 October of sedition over their role in a 2017 referendum outlawed by the Spanish courts and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Shortly after the sentence was given, people in Barcelona received a message on a popular encrypted messaging service telling them to go to Barcelona's El Prat airport, mimicking a tactic used by Hong Kong protesters.

As they made their way to the airport, a group of youths shouted: ""We're going to do a Hong Kong"", according to local media reports.
Catalan protesters have also been distributing infographics made in Hong Kong that detail how demonstrators can protect themselves from police water cannon and tear gas. ""Now people must be in the streets, all revolts start there, look at Hong Kong,"" one protester in Barcelona told AFP news agency. Climate change
Of course, many of the protests that you hear about will have been linked to the environment and climate change. Activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement have been protesting in cities around the world, as they demand urgent action from governments.
The protests have taken place in countries including the US, UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, France and New Zealand. Participants have glued and chained themselves to roads and vehicles, and tried to disrupt busy city centres. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Climate change protesters have tried to disrupt activity in London as they call for urgent action
""We have no choice but to rebel until our government declares a climate and ecological emergency and takes the action that is required to save us,"" said Australian activist Jane Morton.
Young people around the world have also been joining weekly school strikes, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Millions last month joined a global climate strike led by schoolchildren, from handfuls of demonstrators on Pacific islands to mass rallies in cities like Melbourne, Mumbai, Berlin and New York.

18,Hong Kong,Hong Kong officially kills China extradition bill that sparked months of violent protests | The Independent,"The Hong Kong legislature has formally withdrawn the unpopular extradition bill that sparked a months-long protest movement.The semi-autonomous Chinese province‚Äôs leader, Carrie Lam , had initially proposed the bill in February to resolve a case involving a man wanted for murder in Taiwan who could not be sent to face charges because there was no extradition agreement.However the proposals sparked widespread fears that residents would be at risk of being sent to mainland China to face the state‚Äôs Communist Party -controlled courts ‚Äì prompting protests that have engulfed the territory in months of escalating conflict between citizens and the police.From extras.Now, after assurances from Ms Lam in September that the bill would be scrapped in the next meeting of the state‚Äôs legislative council, it has been formally withdrawn by Secretary for Security John Lee.In July, with the city crippled by a summer of disruption, Ms Lam said the government‚Äôs work on the legislation had been a ‚Äútotal failure‚Äù and declared the controversial bill ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äì stopping short of a full withdrawal.But despite having now met what was the central demand of protestors when their demonstrations began in March, it is unlikely the move will deter further conflict.",2019-10-23T10:13:00.000+03:00,independent.co.uk,hong_kong|*|legislature|*|formally|*|withdraw|*|unpopular|*|extradition_bill|*|spark|*|month|*|long|*|protest|*|movement|*|semi|*|autonomous|*|chinese|*|province|*|leader|*|carrie_lam|*|initially|*|propose|*|bill|*|february|*|resolve|*|case|*|involve|*|man|*|want|*|murder|*|taiwan|*|send|*|face|*|charge|*|extradition|*|agreement|*|proposal|*|spark|*|widespread|*|fear|*|resident|*|risk|*|send|*|mainland|*|china|*|face|*|state|*|communist|*|party|*|court|*|prompt|*|protest|*|engulf|*|territory|*|month|*|escalate|*|conflict|*|citizen|*|police|*|extra|*|assurance|*|ms|*|lam|*|september|*|bill|*|scrap|*|meeting|*|state|*|legislative_council|*|-pron-|*|formally|*|withdraw|*|secretary|*|security|*|john|*|lee|*|july|*|city|*|cripple|*|summer|*|disruption|*|ms|*|lam|*|government|*|work|*|legislation|*|total|*|failure|*|declare|*|controversial|*|bill|*|dead|*|stop|*|short|*|withdrawal|*|despite|*|meet|*|central|*|demand|*|protestor|*|-pron-|*|demonstration|*|begin|*|march|*|-pron-|*|unlikely|*|deter|*|conflict
19,Hong Kong,"Stock market news: November 8, 2019","Stocks ended slightly higher, shrugging off earlier losses during the session after President Donald Trump wavered over whether tariffs would be rolled back as part of a partial deal with China.
Each of the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq posted record closing highs Friday and ended higher for the week.
Here‚Äôs where markets settled at the close of regular equity trading:
S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ): +0.26%, or 7.9 points
Dow ( ^DJI ): +0.02%, or 6.44 points
Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ): +0.48%, or 40.8 points
10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ): +1.8 bps to 1.94%
Gold ( GC=F ): -0.43% to $1,460.10 per ounce
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that the U.S. had not yet agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese imports as part of a phase one deal, according to multiple reports.
Earlier this week, a spokesperson for China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce had said both China and the U.S. had agreed to reduce tariffs in the event that a phase one trade deal were passed. This had sent stocks sailing to record highs.
However, developments since had suggested a tariff rollback was still in contention in the White House. Trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested on Fox Business on Thursday that the White House was still undecided over whether to roll back tariffs, and Reuters reported that reducing levies had not been part of the Trump administration‚Äôs and China‚Äôs original handshake deal.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) More Despite the deflating trade optimism Friday, hopes of progress toward an at least partial trade agreement earlier this month and throughout October had helped boost the Chinese economy, where geopolitical concerns had been a drag on growth.
China‚Äôs customs administration reported late Thursday that exports fell less than expected in October, falling 0.9% over last year for the month versus a much steeper 3.9% drop expected. This followed a 3.2% decline in September. Exports to the U.S. slumped by 11.3% for the year-to-date in dollar terms, versus the first 10 months of 2018.
Imports also fell less sharply than expected, declining by 6.4% versus the 7.8% drop anticipated. Taken together, China‚Äôs trade surplus expanded to $42.8 billion, from $39.19 billion in September.
STOCKS: Disney earnings top expectations, Gap guides down Disney ( DIS ) topped expectations in fiscal fourth-quarter results , the company‚Äôs last before its highly anticipated Disney+ streaming service launches in the U.S. on Tuesday. The entertainment powerhouse delivered adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $19.1 billion, better than the 95 cents a share and $19.05 billion expected.
The strong results were broad-based, with its studio entertainment division getting a boost on the back of releases including The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and Aladdin. Its parks and products segment generated more sales and profit than expected amid strong Toy Story and Frozen merchandise sales, offsetting a hit to attendance at Disney World due to Hurricane Dorian, and Hong Kong Disneyland as protests overtook the region.
Gap ( GPS ) announced Thursday that long-tenured CEO Art Peck was stepping down from the company, to be replaced in the interim by Robert Fisher, the son of the company‚Äôs founders. The announcement coincided with a negative guide down for full-year profit. Gap now expects to earn between $1.70 to $1.75 per share, versus the $2.05 to $2.15 per share previously seen.
The retailer has struggled to keep pace with consumer demands, reflected in steepening sales declines at all of its brands. Gap brand sales slumped 7% during the most recent quarter, Banana Republic sales declined 3% and Old Navy fell 4%.
Dropbox ( DBX ) posted better than expected sales and earnings for its fiscal third quarter as the cloud storage company added more paying users during the period. Adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share were two pennies ahead of consensus, and revenue of $428.2 million was ahead of the $423.6 million expected. Paying users grew by nearly 2 million to 14 million during the quarter, and average revenue per paying user grew to $123.15, from $118.60 last year.",2019-11-08T18:30:00.000+02:00,yahoo.com,stock|*|end|*|slightly|*|high|*|shrug|*|early|*|loss|*|session|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|waver|*|tariff|*|roll|*|partial|*|deal|*|china|*|dow|*|nasdaq|*|post|*|record|*|closing|*|high|*|friday|*|end|*|high|*|week|*|market|*|settle|*|close|*|regular|*|equity|*|trading|*|point|*|dow|*|point|*|nasdaq|*|point|*|treasury|*|yield|*|bps|*|gold|*|gc|*|f|*|ounce|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|tell_reporter|*|white_house|*|agree|*|reduce|*|tariff|*|chinese|*|import|*|phase|*|deal|*|accord|*|multiple|*|report|*|early|*|week|*|spokesperson|*|china|*|ministry|*|commerce|*|china|*|agree|*|reduce|*|tariff|*|event|*|phase|*|trade_deal|*|pass|*|send|*|stock|*|sailing|*|record|*|high|*|development|*|suggest|*|tariff|*|rollback|*|contention|*|white_house|*|trade|*|adviser|*|peter|*|navarro|*|suggest|*|fox|*|business|*|thursday|*|white_house|*|undecided|*|roll|*|tariff|*|reuters|*|report|*|reduce|*|levy|*|trump_administration|*|china|*|original|*|handshake|*|deal|*|specialist|*|anthony|*|rinaldi|*|leave|*|trader|*|ashley|*|lara|*|work|*|floor|*|new_york|*|stock|*|exchange|*|thursday|*|ap_photo|*|richard|*|drew|*|despite|*|deflate|*|trade|*|optimism|*|friday|*|hope|*|progress|*|partial|*|trade|*|agreement|*|early|*|month|*|october|*|help|*|boost|*|chinese|*|economy|*|geopolitical|*|concern|*|drag|*|growth|*|china|*|custom|*|administration|*|report|*|late|*|thursday|*|export|*|fall|*|expect|*|october|*|fall|*|year|*|month|*|versus|*|steep|*|drop|*|expect|*|follow|*|decline|*|september|*|export|*|slump|*|year|*|date|*|dollar|*|term|*|versus|*|month|*|import|*|fall|*|sharply|*|expect|*|decline|*|versus|*|drop|*|anticipate|*|china|*|trade|*|surplus|*|expand|*|billion|*|billion|*|september|*|stock|*|disney|*|earning|*|expectation|*|gap|*|guide|*|disney|*|dis|*|expectation|*|fiscal|*|fourth|*|quarter|*|result|*|company|*|-pron-|*|highly|*|anticipated|*|streaming|*|service|*|launch|*|tuesday|*|entertainment|*|powerhouse|*|deliver|*|adjusted_earning|*|share|*|revenue_of_billion|*|cent|*|share|*|billion|*|expect|*|strong|*|result|*|broad|*|base|*|-pron-|*|studio|*|entertainment|*|division|*|boost|*|release|*|include|*|lion|*|king|*|toy|*|story|*|aladdin|*|-pron-|*|park|*|product|*|segment|*|generate|*|sale|*|profit|*|expect|*|amid|*|strong|*|toy|*|story|*|frozen|*|merchandise|*|sale|*|offset|*|hit|*|attendance|*|disney|*|world|*|hurricane|*|dorian|*|hong_kong|*|disneyland|*|protest|*|overtake|*|region|*|gap|*|gps|*|announce|*|thursday|*|long|*|tenure|*|ceo|*|art|*|peck|*|step|*|company|*|replace|*|interim|*|robert|*|fisher|*|son|*|company|*|founder|*|announcement|*|coincide|*|negative|*|guide|*|year|*|profit|*|gap|*|expect|*|earn|*|share|*|versus|*|share|*|previously|*|retailer|*|struggle|*|pace|*|consumer|*|demand|*|reflect|*|steepen|*|sale|*|decline|*|-pron-|*|brand|*|gap|*|brand|*|sale|*|slump|*|recent|*|quarter|*|banana|*|republic|*|sale|*|decline|*|old|*|navy|*|fall|*|dropbox|*|dbx|*|post|*|expect|*|sale|*|earning|*|-pron-|*|fiscal|*|quarter|*|cloud|*|storage|*|company|*|add|*|pay|*|user|*|period|*|adjusted_earning|*|cent_per_share|*|penny|*|ahead|*|consensus|*|revenue|*|million|*|ahead|*|million|*|expect|*|pay|*|user|*|grow|*|nearly|*|million|*|million|*|quarter|*|average|*|revenue|*|pay|*|user|*|grow|*|year
20,Hong Kong,Matthew Hooton: How Phil Twyford went off track,"6 minutes to read Despite renewed denials by the Beehive yesterday, all this has the appearance of the Government soliciting the proposal. Twyford has subsequently appointed Sir Brian chairman of NZTA and yesterday said there is no conflict of interest on the light rail project. The Beehive did not answer questions about whether the Prime Minister knew of Sir Brian's involvement in the Fund proposal before the NZTA appointment. In any case, Twyford's secret dealings with the Fund make a sham of the procurement process he announced last year. Other major infrastructure companies who wasted time and money preparing to pitch will surely now investigate legal mechanisms to seek redress. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Politically, Twyford's conduct represents a major betrayal of all those who were championing the earlier Dominion Rd tram proposal but were kept in the dark that he was seeking bolder alternatives. This includes the bloggers at the Greater Auckland website who have passionately promoted the Dominion Rd tram for some years; Auckland Mayor Phil Goff, who promised it during his first mayoral campaign; local Labour MP Michael Wood, who made it a campaign promise in the 2016 Mt Roskill byelection; NZTA's management and recently replaced directors who knew nothing of the Fund proposal until it was announced; Associate Transport Ministers Julie Anne Genter and Shane Jones; and perhaps even the Prime Minister, who promised the Dominion Rd tram as part of her 2017 election campaign and signed up to it in her subsequent confidence and supply agreement with the Greens. The irony is that had Twyford been open and transparent about actively soliciting better alternatives, he might be hailed as a hero. Instead, his behaviour was characteristic of the previous Government's dealings with SkyCity over the NZ International Convention Centre, which was heavily criticised by the Auditor-General back in 2013, and Clare Curran's secret interactions with RNZ's head of content, for which she was sacked. The problem with the original tram proposal was that it had contradictory objectives. As initially envisaged by its blogger supporters ‚Äî including Grey Lynn photographer Patrick Reynolds, also recently appointed by Twyford to the NZTA board ‚Äî it was all about urban design and housing intensification. There would be lots of stops and it would necessarily be fairly slow, given it would share Queen St and Dominion Rd with buses, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. The public-transport bloggers were surely also pleased it would displace existing roads, reducing the number of people able to drive into town. On its own terms, this makes a certain sense. The problems arose when Goff, the Greens and Labour decided the project was better marketed as light rail to the airport ‚Äî in time for the America's Cup and Apec, no less. For that to be viable, it would need to be much faster, requiring fewer stops and greater separation from other road users. NZTA could never reconcile these conflicting goals. If the politicians wanted to help locals get around Mt Roskill and into town, then maybe trams were a solution. But if they wanted rail to the airport, NZTA saw the obvious option as extending the ≈ånehunga line through MƒÅngere, or a branch line from South Auckland's Puhinui Station, or both. Even more important, NZTA advised that no tram has the power to go up Upper Queen St, demanding tunnelling under the Karangahape Rd ridge alongside the new tunnel being built for the City Rail Link. That and other engineering challenges meant the $4 billion pricetag promised by the politicians was never realistic, and NZTA never used it. Politicians continuing to quote $4b were either not reading their briefing papers or were deliberately misleading the public. Blessed with inside knowledge as early as January 2018 that the Government was not in fact committed to the bloggers' project but wanted more radical alternatives, the Super Fund partnered with Quebec's CDPQ, responsible for the massive new REM system being built in Montreal. Twyford was also kept informed of these talks. Unlike the original tram proposal, the Fund and CDPQ project would be fully integrated with the existing rail network through the Aotea and Mt Eden stations. It would offer 30-minute trips from the CBD to the airport every four minutes. A planned station on the line that the Super Fund's partner is building in Montreal. Will the pair get the chance to build something similar for Auckland? Photo / Supplied It is said to be much quieter than either Auckland's existing trains or the proposed trams, making housing intensification around stations more attractive, higher value and thus more economically sustainable. KiwiRail has been consulted on the Fund proposal so that ‚Äî unlike the tram idea ‚Äî it would not jeopardise the proposed Avondale-Southdown line, necessary to make a new Marsden Point mega-port viable. While as yet publicly unsaid, the Fund is surely also interested in taking its project from Aotea Station to Kumeu, and also to Wynyard Quarter, under the harbour and to the North Shore. This would give Auckland a proper rapid transit system to rival the likes of Hong Kong or Singapore. The Fund presumably has further aspirations to be involved in Marsden Point. All this could be done without extra debt going on the Crown balance sheet and risking Robertson's post-election debt limit of 25 per cent of GDP. Three major questions remain. First, the Fund was meant to fund baby boomers' retirements and healthcare. Is Parliament comfortable for it to evolve into something more like Singapore's Temasek? Second, if the Fund's rapid-transit idea is so good, why doesn't the Government lift its debt cap and just borrow at 1 per cent to build and own the system itself rather than giving the Fund and CDPQ the 8 per cent return being speculated about? Third, the Greens and NZ First are deeply uncomfortable with any ongoing operating profits flowing to Canada. Are New Zealanders happy with Canadians having a minority interest in some of their transport infrastructure? Serious politicians in Labour, National and NZ First really need to reach agreement on these points to make possible the type of radical, long-term projects necessary for Auckland to remain a viable business centre and place to live. Auckland is doomed if its political leaders from left, right or wherever else think its transport needs next decade can be met with a few road-network improvements and a couple of new trams. The Auditor-General and other authorities may yet have something to say about Twyford's conduct over the last 18 months. It would be a tragedy if that meant Auckland rejected the Super Fund's idea and defaulted to the city's mediocre existing plans. - Matthew Hooton is an Auckland based public relations consultant and

21,Hong Kong,,"Patrick Metallic was captured while fighting in Hong Kong during the Second World War and spent nearly four years as a prisoner of war. Social Sharing Jessica Deer ¬∑ CBC News ¬∑ Posted: Nov 08, 2019 4:00 AM ET | Last Updated: November 8 Patrick Metallic was a part of the 1st Bn of the Royal Rifles of Canada during the Second World War.(Submitted by Jane Gray)
Life was not easy for Patrick Metallic, a Mi'kmaq veteran from Listuguj, Que., when he returned home from the Second World War.
As a part of the Royal Rifles of Canada, a rifle regiment in the Canadian Army out of Quebec City, Metallic was one of 1,975 troops in Canada who fought in the Defence of Hong Kong and spent nearly four years as a prisoner of war.
Hong Kong was the first place Canadians fought a land battle in the Second World War. In November 1941, troops from Winnipeg and Quebec City were sent to reinforce the British colony.
On Dec. 8, Japanese forces invaded and overran Hong Kong's defences in 17 days, killing 290 Canadians. Metallic was captured on Christmas Day and spent time in three different POW camps in Hong Kong including Sham Shui Po Camp before being sent to Japan on Jan. 19, 1943, where he was imprisoned in foul conditions and endured brutal treatment.
""He was severely beaten,"" said his grandson Patrick Denny Isaac.
""He was beaten so bad that he swallowed his fake teeth and they had to surgically remove them from his chest.""
During one of the camps, he was slave labour on ships. A letter Patrick Metallic wrote home.(Submitted by Patrick Denny Isaac)
The POWs were liberated in August 1945 after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki forced Japan's surrender and ended the war in the Pacific. Returning home
When Metallic returned home to Listuguj, he was a different person. The undiagnosed post-traumatic stress from his experience caused struggles with alcoholism and violence. He died at the age of 55 on May 19, 1971.
Patricia Metallic-Gray, 80, is one of Metallic's nine children. She describes her childhood as a troubling time when her father returned home.
""It was not very nice. My father had flashbacks all the time. He thought he was still in the war."" said Metallic-Gray.
""That went on for years and years. I hated him because I never understood."" Patricia Metallic-Gray and her daughter Jane Gray.(Submitted by Jane Gray)
In 2010, Metallic-Gray travelled to Hong Kong to learn about what her father experienced as a POW. She said after her trip, she went to the graveyard in Listuguj to apologize to him.
""It lifted a big load off my back,"" she said.
""I finally understood after why he did the things he did, and nobody was around to help him.""
Scott Sheffield, an associate professor of history at the University of the Fraser Valley, has spent the better part of the last two decades researching the military service by Indigenous people in Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the United States.
""A lot of veterans retreated into alcoholism as a way to deal with demons that they returned home with,"" said Sheffield.
""Post-traumatic stress disorder was something that was not well understood. People had a sense that they might be haunted by their experience, but there was no clinical understanding.""",2019-11-08T11:00:00.000+02:00,cbc.ca,patrick|*|metallic|*|capture|*|fight|*|hong_kong|*|second|*|world|*|war|*|spend|*|nearly|*|year|*|prisoner|*|war|*|social|*|sharing|*|jessica|*|deer|*|cbc|*|news|*|post|*|nov|*|et|*|updated|*|november|*|patrick|*|metallic|*|bn|*|royal|*|rifles|*|canada|*|second|*|world|*|jane|*|gray|*|life|*|easy|*|patrick|*|metallic|*|veteran|*|listuguj|*|que|*|-pron-|*|return|*|home|*|second|*|world|*|war|*|royal|*|rifles|*|canada|*|rifle|*|regiment|*|canadian|*|army|*|quebec|*|city|*|metallic|*|troop|*|canada|*|fight|*|defence|*|hong_kong|*|spend|*|nearly|*|year|*|prisoner|*|war|*|hong_kong|*|place|*|canadians|*|fight|*|land|*|battle|*|second|*|world|*|war|*|november|*|troop|*|winnipeg|*|quebec|*|city|*|send|*|reinforce|*|british|*|colony|*|japanese|*|force|*|invade|*|overrun|*|hong_kong|*|defence|*|day|*|kill|*|canadians|*|metallic|*|capture|*|christmas|*|day|*|spend|*|time|*|different|*|pow|*|camp|*|hong_kong|*|include|*|sham|*|shui|*|po|*|camp|*|send|*|japan|*|-pron-|*|imprison|*|foul|*|condition|*|endure|*|brutal|*|treatment|*|-pron-|*|severely|*|beat|*|-pron-|*|grandson|*|patrick|*|denny|*|isaac|*|-pron-|*|beat|*|bad|*|-pron-|*|swallow|*|-pron-|*|fake|*|tooth|*|-pron-|*|surgically|*|remove|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|chest|*|camp|*|-pron-|*|slave|*|labour|*|ship|*|letter|*|patrick|*|metallic|*|write|*|patrick|*|denny|*|isaac|*|pow|*|liberate|*|august|*|atomic|*|bombing|*|hiroshima|*|nagasaki|*|force|*|japan|*|surrender|*|end|*|war|*|pacific|*|return|*|home|*|metallic|*|return|*|home|*|listuguj|*|-pron-|*|different|*|person|*|undiagnosed|*|post|*|traumatic|*|stress|*|-pron-|*|experience|*|cause|*|struggle|*|alcoholism|*|violence|*|-pron-|*|die|*|age|*|patricia|*|metallic|*|gray|*|metallic|*|child|*|-pron-|*|describe|*|-pron-|*|childhood|*|troubling|*|time|*|-pron-|*|father|*|return|*|home|*|-pron-|*|nice|*|-pron-|*|father|*|flashback|*|time|*|-pron-|*|think|*|-pron-|*|war|*|metallic|*|gray|*|year|*|year|*|-pron-|*|hate|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|understand|*|patricia|*|metallic|*|gray|*|-pron-|*|daughter|*|jane|*|jane|*|gray|*|metallic|*|gray|*|travel|*|hong_kong|*|learn|*|-pron-|*|father|*|experience|*|pow|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|trip|*|-pron-|*|graveyard|*|listuguj|*|apologize|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|lift|*|big|*|load|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|finally|*|understand|*|-pron-|*|thing|*|-pron-|*|help|*|-pron-|*|scott|*|sheffield|*|associate|*|professor|*|history|*|university|*|fraser|*|valley|*|spend|*|decade|*|research|*|military|*|service|*|indigenous|*|people|*|canada|*|new_zealand|*|australia|*|united_states|*|lot|*|veteran|*|retreat|*|alcoholism|*|way|*|deal|*|demon|*|-pron-|*|return|*|home|*|sheffield|*|post|*|traumatic|*|stress|*|disorder|*|understand|*|people|*|sense|*|-pron-|*|haunt|*|-pron-|*|experience|*|clinical|*|understanding
22,Hong Kong,"Hong Kong, Chile, Lebanon: protests erupt around the world | South China Morning Post","\n Protests flare around the world, each with its own trigger, but many of the underlying frustrations are similar \n In Hong Kong it was the extradition bill. In Chile, it was a 4 US cent rise in the price of a metro ticket, while in Lebanon it was a tax on WhatsApp calls. Street protests have erupted around the world for different reasons. Here‚Äôs a glance at what‚Äôs been happening. In Hong Kong it was the extradition bill. In Chile, it was a 4 US cent rise in the price of a metro ticket, while in Lebanon it was a tax on WhatsApp calls. Street protests have erupted around the world for different reasons. Here‚Äôs a glance at what‚Äôs been happening. Hong Kong Hong Kong has been battered by five months of often violent protests over fears Beijing is tightening its grip on the territory, in the worst political crisis since colonial ruler Britain handed it back to China in 1997. Protests against a proposal to allow extraditions of criminal suspects to mainland China morphed into increasingly angry and sometimes violent anti-government, pro-democracy mobilisation. The extradition bill has been withdrawn and there have been few major rallies in recent weeks. But violence has escalated at those held, with militant activists setting MTR stations ablaze and smashing up shops, often targeting Chinese banks and stores with mainland links. \n \n \n Police have fired thousands of rounds of tear gas, hundreds of rubber bullets and three live rounds at brick- and petrol bomb-throwing activists. More than 2000 people have been arrested, hundreds of them below the age of 18. The events in Hong Kong have drawn comparisons to Catalonia in recent days. There, too, people are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, if not outright independence. China‚Äôs top diplomat in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, labelled the ongoing protests an independence campaign to overthrow the government , appealing to the international community not to stay silent as the city‚Äôs ‚Äúvirus of street violence‚Äù spreads overseas. \n Spain Catalonia, the wealthy northeastern region of Spain, has been rocked by protests since October 14 when nine Catalan separatist leaders were convicted to long jail terms over sedition for leading a failed 2017 bid for independence that included holding a banned referendum. Many in Catalonia who have taken to the streets have cited the demonstrations in Hong Kong as a source of inspiration. Tactics popularised in Hong Kong ‚Äì such as the use of yellow hard hats and using boarding passes to bypass airport security checks ‚Äì have been met in Barcelona with tear gas and rubber bullets fired by Spanish police. The issue of Catalan independence has dominated Spain‚Äôs fractured political debate in recent years and is likely to continue to do so in the run-up to next month‚Äôs ballot. Spain‚Äôs PM under pressure as Catalan separatists copy Hong Kong protest tactics Chile Just weeks before the worst civil unrest since Chile returned to democracy 29 years ago, President Sebastian Pinera described the country as ‚Äúa true oasis‚Äù. His country is planning hosting of world leaders, including US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, for the annual Apec summit on November 16-17. However, deadly upheaval in October shows the chasm between the Andean exemplar‚Äôs elite and those who feel abandoned. Eighteen people have died and thousands have been arrested in a wave of riots and demonstrations that‚Äôs brought cities to a near standstill and seen security forces fire on masked looters. What began as a protest against a 4 US cent subway fare hike quickly became an outpouring of broad discontent over economic inequality, pensions, health and education. While Pinera back-pedalled on the fare increase, his efforts to crack down on violence merely intensified it. Chile‚Äôs president offers measures to quell violent street protests before Apec summit in Santiago Lebanon Lebanon‚Äôs biggest demonstrations in 15 years have unified an often-divided public in their revolt against status-quo leaders who have ruled for three decades and brought the economy to the brink of disaster. The protests were sparked October 17 by a proposal to introduce fees for users of messaging apps such as WhatsApp, with the aim of shoring up the state‚Äôs coffers. The demonstrators accuse the country‚Äôs political class of mismanagement and wasting public funds, with rallies spreading to all major cities and into Lebanon‚Äôs vast diaspora. They have called on the government to resign. The government has tried to quell public anger with wide-ranging economic reforms but the move has so far failed to win over protesters, who now seem bent on removing the entire political elite, which they see as corrupt. ‚ÄòBaby Shark‚Äô song unites angry protesters in Lebanon after adorable toddler video goes viral Iraq Iraq was rocked by protests during the first week of October, with thousands taking to the streets of Baghdad and the country‚Äôs south to demand jobs, services and an end to corruption. The protests quickly turned bloody, with an official toll citing 157 people killed, mainly protesters in the capital. The government held an inquiry into the violence, producing a report on Tuesday that condemned ‚Äúexcessive use‚Äù of force by security personnel but also cited unknown ‚Äúshooters‚Äù that authorities have neither identified nor arrested. Protests flared again on October 25 and 26, leaving at least 63 protesters dead. The violence, Iraq‚Äôs worst since an Islamic State insurgency was put down in 2017, has posed the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office a year ago. How Iraqis dodged internet blackout to tell world about protest bloodshed Bolivia The landlocked South American nation has seen mass demonstrations, violent clashes and arson attacks since the disputed presidential election on October 20. President Evo Morales was the third leader in the region to declare a state of emergency in October. The opposition accuse the government of fraud, after updates of a preliminary vote count were mysteriously suspended for 24 hours on Sunday night. Morales, who is seeking a fourth term, has declared victory. He has likened the unrest to a right-wing coup. Haiti The poorest country in the Americas has been roiled for two months by protests that were triggered by fuel shortages and have now turned violent. And they have morphed into a broader campaign against President Jovenel Moise, who came to power in 2017 in an election that some called fraudulent. The protests are spreading: in recent weeks, various professional or social groups have taken to the streets against the president one after another, such as university students and artists. Things are so tense in Haiti with violence breaking out at protest rallies that schools have been closed for more than a month. Ecuador Ecuador was hit by 12 days of demonstrations, led by indigenous groups, against fuel price hikes until President Lenin Moreno reached a deal with protest leaders on October 13. Indonesia Protests convulsed Indonesia‚Äôs easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua, on the island of New Guinea ‚Äì collectively known as Papua ‚Äì for two weeks in late August. The sometimes violent unrest erupted after a group of Papuan students in Surabaya, Indonesia‚Äôs second city on the island of Java, were taunted and attacked by a mob chanting racial epithets over accusations they had desecrated a national flag. After the August protests began, Indonesia sent about 6,000 additional military and police personnel to the region, and authorities blocked internet access for a time to prevent use of social media. Then in late September, 37 people died and scores were hurt during clashes in the Papua cities of Wamena and Jayapura. Government offices and homes were burned down, and 250 cars and motorcycles destroyed, as indigenous Papuans and security forces clashed. Indonesia‚Äôs human rights commission has called for a probe into and how government troops handled the unrest. The former Dutch colony declared its independence in the early 1960s, but it was incorporated into Indonesia following a widely criticised UN-backed referendum.

23,Hong Kong,Wall Street keeps embarrassing itself every time Trump talks about China,"It's quite possible that this is President Donald Trump's ""Got you again, Wall Street"" face. Who can really say? AP Photo Every time President Donald Trump says he has a trade deal with China the stock market rallies. And then it turns out the deal is vapor. Meanwhile, US-China relations continue to deteriorate in the background, making anyone bullish on a deal look even more absurd. Stop it, Wall Street ‚Äî you're embarrassing yourself. And we hate to see it.
People, people, people. Why does this keep happening?
On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he had a trade deal with China, and stocks soared. All was well in the universe of Wall Street. The administration gave itself a pat on the back.
A few hours later, though, everyone figured out that this ""phase-one deal"" sounded a lot like the trade-war d√©tente the US and China came to last December . In this latest ""mini-deal,"" just like the agreement from nine months ago, both parties agreed that China would buy some agricultural goods here and there, and in exchange the US tariffs would not increase for the time being.
(There are more details, we have to assume, but they are difficult to grasp since the agreement wasn't written down or anything this time .)
Of course, this deal leaves untouched the deep structural disagreements between the US and China ‚Äî issues that include major changes to China's business practices and law enforcement ‚Äî unresolved. These are the issues at the core of the Trump administration's justification to launch the trade war.
And lo, in the days that followed the announcement of this ""phase-one deal,"" the cracks started to show: China began backing away from the idea that it would buy $50 billion of agricultural products as Trump said it would. China also said that it would like to go through another round of talks before officially agreeing to anything . And then China said Trump would have to remove all tariffs before the trade deal, making ""phase two"" that much harder to reach.
The S&P 500, to its credit, is flat for the month ‚Äî phase-one deal or no. But it seems every time the president makes one of these pronouncements, the market gets excited, only to be let down again.
Let me tell you a story about the president. From 1986 to 1988, Trump reportedly made millions by betting in the stock market . His strategy was to leak to Wall Street that he was going to take over a company, like a real corporate raider. Then he'd quietly sell his shares before everyone figured out that he was bluffing.
It all ended because after two years Wall Street figured out that Trump's bark was much worse than his bite.
How long is it going to take this time? President Pump-and-Dump
Meanwhile, as Trump pumps his trade deal and Wall Street foolishly gets their hopes up, the rest of US-Chinese diplomatic relations are in meltdown mode. The Trump administration sanctioned individuals tied to China's Uighur concentration camps in Xinjiang. An act China has said it will retaliate against. The Trump administration is still playing with blacklisting China's telecom darling, Huawei.
So while Trump may say the trade war with China is on the road to resolution, in the rest of the relationship chaos reigns.
And according to Sam Bresnick and Paul Haenle at Foreign Policy , there are some in China who like it that way.
To them, a Donald Trump who is willing to allow democracy to waver in Hong Kong (and the rest of Asia), who is not trusting of his allies, who is easily fooled, is a president who could create the kind of opening that would allow China to gain ground on a swiftly tilting planet. One Chinese thinker called it the ""greatest strategic opportunity since the end of the Cold War.""
From their piece , which is very much worth reading: During numerous off-the-record discussions with Chinese government officials and scholars, we are finding that an increasing number are hoping for Trump's reelection next year. At a time when China's political influence and military capabilities are growing, they argue that in spite of his anti-China bluster, Trump has afforded Beijing the space to expand its influence across Asia and, more importantly, comprehensively weakened Washington's global leadership. From a zero-sum standpoint, many Chinese have concluded that Trump's policies are strategically very good for China in the long run.
On top of all these complications is the simple matter of trust. Last month, Beijing hosted a China Development Forum Special Session attended by politicians and technocrats the world over. The message out of that, according to Susan Thornton, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was that the Chinese don't think Trump is acting in good faith.
""They think Trump wants to have the China fight going into November elections,"" she said during a phone call with Business Insider. ""They think he doesn't want to make a deal.""
Thornton told us that the US and Chinese sides are having trouble understanding each other. Chinese diplomats tend to be subtle in their dealings; the US president is not a subtle man.
""Trump is presiding over the bleeding of US credibility,"" Thornton said. ""There's no way the Chinese believe in the US ... and after seeing Trump's antics on the world stage how anyone is going to do a deal with us ever again?"" If we're stuck in phase one
Now, you may be thinking to yourself: At least the trade war isn't getting worse. If we're stuck in phase one, we're stuck in phase one.
Problem is, phase one is already causing chaos in the global economy. Up until September, the US consumer was the undisputed champion holding things together in a world of negative interest rates, slumping trade and manufacturing data, and declining business investment.
But last month, US retail sales started to sag. And now the Federal Reserve's Beige Book ‚Äî a quarterly survey of businesses around the US released last week ‚Äî is replete with complaints about how the trade war is constraining sales and raising input prices.
Then there's what's going on in China, the world's second-largest economy. Last quarter, GDP growth slowed to its lowest rate in three decades, 6% . Trade, manufacturing, industrial production ‚Äî all declining. The one bright spot is infrastructure investment, which is supported by the government and widely considered a playground for dangerous shadow banking.
The world needs a real US-China trade deal if economic growth is going to return to the planet, not the fake deals the Trump administration keeps serving up. Wall Street ‚Äî the so-called masters of the universe and the underlings who serve them ‚Äî should be smart enough to know a real deal when they see one. But no. So far they've bought just about every pump the president has sold them. We hate to see it.

24,Hong Kong,"China Bans Kids From Video Games After 10 p.m., Sets Daily Time Limit","China Bans Kids From Video Games After 10 p.m., Sets Daily Time Limit Laying down the law. Updated: 7 Nov 2019 5:49 pm Posted: 7 Nov 2019 5:49 pm The Chinese government has introduced new regulations that limit when children can play video games, the alotted time, and the amount of money they spend on microtransactions.As reported by The New York Times (via Kotaku ), the Chinese National Press and Publication Administration said the measures aim to benefit ""the physical and mental health of minors."" The law became effective as of Tuesday this week, stating anyone under the age of 18 cannot play games for more than 90 minutes a day from Monday through Friday. On weekends or holidays that number is slackened slightly to three hours. Loading Also included in the measures are a curfew that forbids young people from playing games between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. (meaning no more overnight sessions) and a limit on the amount kids can spend on DLC and microtransactions. The figure varies depending on how old the player is, but works out as between $28 to $57 a month.The law will be enforced by ensuring minors register their real names and identification numbers when they connect to the internet to play. This means the Chinese video game market will be one of the most heavily regulated in the world ‚Äì but since it's worth $33 billion in annual revenue , it's also one of the most valuable.Like in the West, video games in China have become a political football with state-run media branding some games as ""poison."" President Xi Jinping has been stringent in regulating tech companies during his second term of office, and in the last year, licensing freezes and other strict measures have slowed the Chinese games industry's growth. The Blizzard China Controversy Explained 12 IMAGES Elsewhere, Blizzard faced international criticism after banning a player for voicing support for the Hong Kong protests . The attempt by Blizzard ‚Äì an American company ‚Äì to dampen potential political offense to the Chinese government was seen by some as an effort to protect its finances in the foreign market, but if you're just catching up here's a full explainer .

26,Tesla,Tesla cites Brexit as Germany chosen over UK for European plant | Technology | The Guardian,"US electric carmaker will build battery factory in Berlin, says boss Elon Musk. The Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Brexit uncertainty played a role in the firm‚Äôs decision to build its first European factory in Germany rather than the UK.
The billionaire entrepreneur revealed that the firm‚Äôs European battery plant would be built on the outskirts of Berlin.
Speaking to Auto Express after making the announcement, Musk said: ‚ÄúBrexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK.‚Äù
The US electric carmaker also plans to locate a research and development base in the German capital. Musk announced the Berlin decision at a car industry awards ceremony on Tuesday night hosted by the German tabloid Bild.
He said : ‚ÄúSome of the best cars in the world are made in Germany. Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding, for sure, and that‚Äôs part of the reason why we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany. We are also going to create an engineering and design centre in Berlin.‚Äù
In November 2016, Musk downplayed the effects of Brexit and said Tesla planned to build an R&D base in the UK. He had previously said that if there was sufficient demand a factory could subsequently be built in the UK, although Tesla planned to open its first European factory on the continent.
Aside from batteries, Tesla will also build its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Berlin. Production is expected to start in 2021. Musk told the awards audience: ‚ÄúI come to Berlin a lot ‚Äì Berlin rocks!‚Äù

Ford Bronco revealed in Baja 1000 race truck form This Bronco R race truck strongly hints at the production SUV we'll see next year.
Sean Szymkowski November 4, 2019 6:45 PM PST Enlarge Image
Yeah, the new Bronco is shaping up nicely.
Ford Surprise! This might not be the production Ford Bronco , but it's definitely our best look yet at the forthcoming SUV. Ford revealed this new Bronco R race truck in the Nevada desert on Monday, and we got a chance to see it up close.
This Bronco R comes at an appropriate time. Fifty years ago, Rod Hall and Larry Minor piloted a race-prepped Bronco in the 1969 Baja 1000 to an overall race win. As Ford proudly boasts, no other 4x4 has replicated the original Bronco's success since then. Now, it hopes the reborn Bronco will be able to mirror the victory.
Now playing: Watch this: The Ford Bronco is going to Baja 2:53 That's correct -- this isn't just some Bronco to celebrate a milestone -- it's going racing. Later this month, the Bronco R will head to the Baja Peninsula to once again tackle the grueling off-road race with a proper driver to boot. None other than Shelby Hall, Rod Hall's granddaughter, will pilot the Bronco R for parts of the race. The 1,000-mile trek will put the Bronco's production powertrain to the test. We still don't know what exactly that powertrain is, however, but Ford referenced the twin-turbo EcoBoost engine attached to this racing prototype is ""representative of what the production Bronco will offer.""
Ford put together a bit of a skunkworks team to make this thing happen. Paul Wraith, lead Bronco designer, curated a small team that worked in a sealed room in the basement of Ford's design studio. They emerged with what you see here in just six months. The SUV's width and race-ready parts clearly mask a production stance, but Ford was keen to underline that the overall look is close to what we'll see from the production Bronco.
From that, it's safe to say the body shape will look very similar and the front grille with ""Bronco"" spelled out across seems like a no-brainer for the production SUV. Use your imagination, and you'll be able to see where production headlights will go and start to fill in other cues. Checking over the rear doesn't reveal too much in race form, but imagine some blocky taillights and that spare tire mounted flush with the rear. A clamshell hood and roof also harken back to the first-generation Bronco. It certainly looks like Ford won't disappoint loyalists with the SUV's overall shape. This looks like a proper off-road SUV with surprisingly elegant lines.
Ford Bronco comes to life in off-road-ready R form 21 Photos For racing purposes, there's a lot that won't make it to any production Bronco. Although it sits on the automaker's T6 architecture (that's for the production Bronco), there's a roll cage, independent front suspension with 14 inches of travel and a five-link rear chassis design that can move around 18 inches. Custom Fox shocks, 17-inch wheels and 37-inch tires help make the Bronco R a menacing-looking thing. Virtual reality and even 3D-printed parts helped this racing SUV come to life so quickly and in time for the race start.
We got a quick ride in the Bronco R with Baja 1000 champion Cameron Steele behind the wheel outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. The motor pulls strong, sounding not unlike the 3.5-liter high output V6 found in the Raptor, although that has not been confirmed by Ford. The Bronco R cruised over the lake bed and a few whoops at 80-plus miles per hour; a comfy ride with all that travel soaking up the bumps easily.
This is quite the appetizer. For those eagerly awaiting the production Bronco, it should certainly help ease the pain. Ford plans to drop the sheet from the production SUV next spring . The Bronco R will take to the start line on Nov. 22.

29,Tesla,EarthLink - News,"Tesla to build factory in Germany after subsidies announced
By GEIR MOULSON | Wed, November 13, 2019 12:35 EST
BERLIN (AP) ‚Äî Germany on Wednesday hailed Tesla‚Äôs decision to build its first European factory in the country, days after the government said it would boost subsidies for buyers of electric cars.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an awards ceremony in the German capital Tuesday evening that ‚Äúwe‚Äôve decided to put the Tesla Gigafactory Europe in the Berlin area.‚Äù
The company will also set up an engineering and design center in Berlin, Musk said. He wrote on Twitter that the new plant ‚Äúwill build batteries, powertrains & vehicles, starting with Model Y.‚Äù
The Model Y is a small SUV scheduled to go on sale in the fall of 2020. It will start at $39,000 (35,400 euros) with a range of 230 miles (370 kilometers) per charge.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called the announcement a ‚Äúglorious success‚Äù for the country‚Äôs attractiveness to the auto industry, especially in the race to develop and produce electric cars and batteries.
Altmaier said there had been competition for the plant among European countries in recent months, but denied that the government had offered any financial support to Tesla.
‚ÄúSo far, subsidies haven‚Äôt been discussed,‚Äù he told reporters in Berlin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that Tesla will be treated the same way as all other automobile companies if it invests in Germany and creates jobs here.‚Äù
In an interview with British publication Auto Express, Musk said uncertainty over Britain‚Äôs planned exit from the European Union ‚Äî and thereby the world‚Äôs biggest trading bloc ‚Äî had been a factor in not building the new plant there.
‚ÄúBrexit made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,‚Äù Musk was Quote: d as saying.
Tesla did not respond to requests to elaborate on how Brexit helped swing it for Berlin, but German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters that ‚Äúwe see in it proof of trust in Germany as a location for innovation.‚Äù
Tesla‚Äôs announcement comes just a week after German officials and auto industry leaders agreed to increase by half the existing government incentives for electric vehicles with a list price of up to 40,000 euros ($44,500) ‚Äî an incentive Tesla can expect to profit from indirectly.
The subsidy will also be extended from the end of 2020 currently to the end of 2025, and the government and industry agreed to aim for 50,000 publicly accessible charging stations nationwide by 2022.
Musk said that the plan is for the factory to be built near Berlin‚Äôs new airport, which is located just outside the city limits in neighboring Brandenburg state and currently slated to open next year after years of delays.
‚ÄúWe definitely need to move faster than the airport, that‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù Musk said.
Germany, home to some of the world‚Äôs biggest automakers, has been overtaken by the United States, China and some European neighbors in the adoption of electric vehicles.
In July, Tesla announced plans to build its third Gigafactory ‚Äî the first outside the U.S. ‚Äî in Shanghai.
German automaker Volkswagen, which last week began mass production of its ID.3 electric car, welcomed rival Tesla‚Äôs decision to build the factory on its home turf.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that Elon is, let‚Äôs say, pulling us, but I think the German industry is really now strongly investing,‚Äù said Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, speaking alongside Musk at Tuesday‚Äôs event. ‚ÄúAnd we will keep you alert.‚Äù
Auto industry expert Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer said additional competition could benefit German automakers.

30,Tesla,Massive car collection seized from owners of bankrupt DC Solar up for auction | Fox News,"Collector Cars Published 6 days ago Massive car collection seized from owners of bankrupt DC Solar up for auction By Gary Gastelu | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Massive car collection seized from owners of bankrupt DC Solar up for auction A massive car collection is going up for auction. Seized from owners of bankrupt energy company DC Solar there‚Äôs bound to be the car you are looking for.
An incredible collection of nearly 150 classic and modern cars is coming up for auction, but they each come with a conflicted history.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
The cars were seized by the feds from the owners of DC Solar, who have been accused of running the bankrupt solar-powered generator company as an $800 million Ponzi scheme.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
Jeff and Paulette Carpoff haven‚Äôt been charged with any crimes as of yet, according to the U.S. Attoney‚Äôs office, but their situation remains under investigation. In the meantime, the Carpoffs and the Department of Justice agreed to hold an interlocutory sale and put the proceeds into a seized asset account, rather than continue to incur expenses for the storage and maintenance of the vehicles. The sale is being handled by the U.S. Marshals Service and Apple Auctioneering Co. in Woodland, Calif.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
‚ÄúIt is rare for the U.S. Marshals to hold an auction of such a stunning collection of vehicles,‚Äù said Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Lasha Boyden of the Sacramento office.

DC Solar was a NASCAR sponsor for some time, and the collection reflects an interest in gas-guzzling American performance cars old and new. Along with a 1969 Dodge Daytona and three 1970 Plymouth Superbirds, there‚Äôs a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon and six Ford Mustangs from the 1960s.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
Nevertheless, there are two Teslas and five Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrids among the lots.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
They also include plenty of vintage pickup trucks, four Hummer H1s and a 1965 Plymouth Fury LAPD tribute car, but it‚Äôs one from the other side of the law that‚Äôs the most unique model in the bunch.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
It‚Äôs a 1978 Pontiac Trans Am that‚Äôs not just customized to look like the one from the ‚ÄúSmokey and the Bandit‚Äù film , but was once owned by Burt Reynolds himself. Reynolds commissioned several over the years, the last of which was sold at an auction in June for $317,500.
(Apple Auctioneering Co.)
Online bidding for the cars is already underway and will run through a live event in Woodland on Oct. 26.

31,Tesla,Always pads: Always is removing the female symbol from its packaging to be more LGBTQ inclusive - CBS News,"By Sophie Lewis
Updated on: October 22, 2019 / 9:37 PM / CBS News
Always to remove female symbol from products Always is officially removing the Venus female symbol from the packing of its menstruation products . The announcement follows pleas from LGBTQ activists to make the labeling more inclusive of transgender and non-binary customers.
""For over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so,"" the brand's parent company Procter & Gamble said in a statement. ""We're also committed to diversity & inclusion and are on a continual journey to understand the needs of all of our consumers.""
LGBTQ activist Ben Saunders reportedly asked Always over the summer to change its packaging to be more inclusive . Saunders was named Young Campaigner of the Year by the charity Stonewall after producing a short film highlighting transgender people in the U.K.

Biggest losers from Adam Neumann's $1.7 billion WeWork payday CVS, Rite Aid and Walmart pull J&J baby powder from shelves The packaging change will happen starting in 2020, a spokesperson told CBS News.
""We routinely assess our products, packaging, and designs,"" P&G said. ""We take into account a broad array of factors, including feedback from consumers, to ensure we are meeting the needs of everyone who uses our products. The change to our pad wrapper design is consistent with that practice, and will be adapted by multiple markets at various dates.""
LGBTQ activists and allies have been publicly asking P&G to redesign the packaging to be more gender-neutral. They argued that using the female symbol is exclusive because not all women menstruate, and not all people who menstruate identify as women.

hi @Always i understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods, and if you could please do something about the ‚ôÄÔ∏èsymbol on your pad packaging, i‚Äôd be happy. i‚Äôd hate to have any trans males feel dysphoric.
‚Äî jocelyn ‚ú∞ (@phiddies) October 13, 2019 While LGBTQ and health advocates championed the move, a number of customers expressed outrage that the change appears to ""eliminate"" women. The hashtag #BoycottAlways sparked a slew of transphobic comments on social media.
But those who support the change said eliminating gendered packaging could help relieve some of the dysphoria experienced by transgender and non-binary people.
""Some trans men/non binary people menstruate. As do cis women who despise overly feminine products,"" tweeted Dr. Jen Gunter , an OB-GYN. ""Cis women who can't menstruate and trans women are harmed by the assumption that menstruation defines femininity. Less ink for printing better for planet. This is a win all around.""

32,Tesla,Wall Street is back in love with chip stocks,"Chip stocks are suddenly back in vogue. Intel‚Äôs stock (INTC ) rallied 7.5% in mid-afternoon trading after the company reported record third-quarter profits and raised its full-year sales guidance. The rosy report is despite the U.S.-China trade war, capacity shortages, and increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) .
Intel‚Äôs stellar news comes just days after a disastrous third quarter for rival Texas Instruments (TXN) , which also included a gloomy outlook.
‚ÄúWe are getting a very mixed picture of the semiconductor industry right now because the demand signals are distorted by trade,‚Äù Vivek Arya, U.S. semiconductors analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Yahoo Finance‚Äôs ‚Äú The First Trade .‚Äù
Despite a somewhat cloudy backdrop, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) is up nearly 28% so far this year, compared with the S&P 500 index (^GSPC) , which is up nearly 12% in that same period.
‚ÄúThe good news for semiconductors is that this is not just a China story, this is a cloud story, this is an AI story, this is a 5G story, and there is a new cycle in gaming.‚Äù
Arya says growth drivers for the semiconductor industry are more diversified than ever, and that investors should be sure to differentiate between chipmakers that have different kinds of exposure.
Texas Instruments DSP chips, photo on black More ‚ÄúTexas Instruments is more exposed to the cyclical parts of the economy such as industrial and automotive,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, Intel is exposed more to a PC market that has actually been pretty stable this year, exposed to more cloud spending, and Intel has had a number of product introductions this year.‚Äù
Growth drivers in 2020 Arya believes a big driver of growth for the semiconductor industry in 2020 will be the adoption of 5G, including the construction of 5G networks, as well as the demand for 5G smartphones.
‚ÄúTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is very exposed to the 5G sector,‚Äù says Arya, ‚Äúand so it‚Äôs buying a lot of semiconductor capital equipment‚Äù to prepare for a larger rollout of the next generation cellular network technology.
In contrast, Arya says Intel wants to benefit from an increase in cloud demand and the increasing bandwidth that will be required to support 5G infrastructure.
Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has been on a tear, up more than 40% year-to-date, and it‚Äôs one of Arya‚Äôs top picks this year. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going through a number of new product cycles next year in gaming and AI, conversational AI specifically and natural language processing that we think will be the next big thing.‚Äù
Arya says demand for computing will be big drivers of growth in 2020 for chipmakers including Intel, Broadcom (AVGO) , AMD and Nvidia. Investors will get more clues on the health of the chip sector Oct. 29, when AMD reports its third-quarter results.

33,Tesla,"Uber needs to buy Lyft to survive, and finally make profits - Business Insider","Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Uber is still losing money at an alarming rate. The problem is that, to turn a profit, Uber needs to stop cutting prices to win customers from competitors like Lyft. So the solution for Uber is simple: Buy Lyft. After an acquisition of Lyft, Uber can leverage its new scale to profitability. Ibrahim AlHusseini is the founder and CEO of FullCycle, an investment firm focused on addressing the climate crisis. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .
Technology-enabled ride hailing has transformed the possibilities for urban mobility, combatting climate change and creating more livable cities in the 21st century. That's the good news.
The bad news is that the top players in the category in the US ‚Äî Uber and Lyft ‚Äî don't have viable business models. The latest earnings reports make that clear. In the third quarter of 2019, Uber alone lost about $1.2 billion .
Which brings us to the inevitable: Uber's acquisition of Lyft. Uber needs to buy Lyft to live
Implicit in Uber's argument is that one day it will control all, or at least the vast majority, of the ride-hailing market. That's not a want for the business; it's a need.
The positive network effect doesn't really work for Uber. Having more drivers and, as a result, more passengers, and, by extension, lower wait times, isn't enough. So long as there is competition, Uber will continue to have to lure passengers and drivers with more and more subsidies.
That's because there's really nothing proprietary about Uber's platform, or Lyft's, or that of any of the big players. In fact, even an autonomous-vehicle offering is likely to become a commodity. So to become profitable on the car-sharing side of the house, Uber needs to become a winner-take-all by merging with Lyft.
If Uber waits on this acquisition, Google could sweep in and buy Lyft, creating a three-way marriage between Waymo, maps (Google Maps and Waze), and Lyft. That would lead to a much bigger, and much more formidable, competitor to Uber. Indeed, Lyft and Waymo are already working together . Uber also needs to expand its thinking
But the acquisition is only one part of a strategy to get to profitability.
Until Uber takes a more collaborative approach to working with government, the race to the bottom will continue ‚Äî with nobody, save maybe the taxi industry, benefiting.
Throwing massive chunks of cash into their marketing, ride and driver subsidization, and research and development around initiatives that may or may not pay dividends will be punished in every quarterly report, as it was this week.
In the context of combating climate change and creating more livable cities, drawing passengers away from public transport like the subway in New York and adding more cars will only increase traffic, pollution, and frustration. (Uber's head of global policy for public transportation has already acknowledged that his company is contributing to congestion on the roads.)
In New York, regulators have enacted fleet caps to limit the number of Ubers and Lyfts on the street while collecting information about when and where they drive. And a new California law mandates these businesses hire drivers as employees rather than independent contractors, meaning they must provide benefits.
Which is why Uber needs to start making its regulators its customers.
One major challenge Uber and Lyft face is the fact that one of their competitors, public transportation, is a government-subsidized entity. Subway systems, bus systems, ferry systems, even the sidewalks for people to walk on, are supported by taxpayers. It's tough to compete with that.
So Uber should be more intentional about becoming part of the solution, and do what Via does.
Arlington, Texas, went without a public transit system before partnering with Via in 2017. Now, Via operates a broad network of six-seat vans in Arlington, essentially providing public transportation to the entire city, which in turn subsidizes Via rides through its local transit budget. Via expects to be operating in 200 cities globally by the end of 2019, with most of those cities following the ""transit as service"" model.
And guess what: When you work with government and you make communities healthier and save taxpayers money, regulators are less likely to make your life harder through new rules, new regulations, and new taxes.
There are other growth opportunities that Uber ought to double down on: food and freight.
Already, Uber Eats is one of the world's largest food-delivery services. It could generate $1 billion in revenue this year alone. The business faces real competition in Eats too (Grubhub, DoorDash), but there are creative fixes. Uber Eats is already global and has considerable reach via the ride-hailing platform, which gives it a leg up in terms of building partnerships with major brands like Starbucks .
Meanwhile, Uber Freight represents tremendous growth potential: By connecting truck drivers and shippers and ensuring we have fewer nonfull trucks on our roads, Uber Freight solves a real problem by making trucking far more efficient.
Then there's advertising.
Uber has 91 million active users across its platforms globally. And Uber knows a lot about these people: what they eat and where they go and when. Uber could start to leverage this massive network and sell ads, in the app, in cars, in the delivery package, and beyond. Indeed, Uber could become one of the world's largest advertising platforms.
Whereas users don't need to go on Facebook, people who open up the Uber app need to eat or need to travel somewhere. For key moments they represent a very captive audience, which is why Uber needs to invest heavily in advertising.
Ultimately, for any high-growth business, attacking a space as a new upstart is very different from defending one as a large incumbent. For Uber, now is the time to get to profitability and prove that the future of ride hailing is part of a larger, more robust strategy for consumers, cities, and the world.
It all starts with buying Lyft.
Ibrahim AlHusseini is the founder and CEO of FullCycle, an investment firm focused on addressing the climate crisis. He was an early investor in Uber, Lyft, and Tesla, though he is no longer invested in those companies.

34,Tesla,Space startup CEO: 'You need regulation' of space ‚Äî there isn't 'a cop up there',"Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX recently applied for permission to launch 30,000 more Starlink satellites into space, according to SpaceNews.
This is on top of the 12,000 already approved by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, not to mention that SpaceX already deployed 60 units back in May. The notion of tens and thousands of hovering low-earth orbiting satellites in the near future may sound like a traffic controller‚Äôs nightmare. One satellite startup CEO believes space is a ‚Äú shared resource ‚Äù and calls for regulations to level the playing field.
‚ÄúAs a startup, you think that we would not want to be regulated. That's sort of anathema ‚Äî you want to push the limits and do everything you can, but it's a shared resource,‚Äù said Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, on Yahoo Finance‚Äôs The Ticker .
IN SPACE - FEBRUARY 8: In this handout photo provided by SpaceX, a Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket with a dummy driver named ""Starman"" heads towards Mars. (Photo by SpaceX via Getty Images) More ‚ÄúI think that in the greater context, if you look at companies in general, you need regulation, because there really isn't a cop up there,‚Äù he said
He gives the analogy that after a car crash, drivers and passengers walk away from the crash site, and a tow truck tows the cars. But he pointed out that his satellites travel at 16,800 miles per hour. He said at that speed, satellites are ‚Äúgoing to shatter‚Äù and the debris left from the crash will ‚Äúspoil that space for everybody.‚Äù
‚ÄúEverybody needs sort of fair rules, and understanding that everybody plays by the rules to preserve that‚Ä¶ Because it's not that I spoil it for myself, I spoil it for everybody,‚Äù he added.
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 03: OneWeb CEO Adrian Steckel speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2019 at Moscone Convention Center on October 03, 2019 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch) More Startup rivalling SpaceX and Blue Origin in the space race OneWeb is a Softbank-backed startup rivaling SpaceX and Jeff Bezos‚Äôs Blue Origin to launch thousands of washing machine-size satellites in low-earth orbit. Its endgame? To bring high-speed internet to the world, including the arctic.
To get ahead of this race, the startup must be able to scale as quickly as possible. The good news is that costs of production are falling.
‚ÄúIt used to be that a geosatellite would cause $250 million ‚Äî we've gotten those costs down to a million, and that's going lower,‚Äù said Steckel. ‚ÄúLaunch costs are also coming down,‚Äù he added.
With Blue Origin right across the road, OneWeb‚Äôs factory at Cape Canaveral has its sights on the competitor, and is churning out satellites at speed. Steckel said he owes their ability to scale to robotization.
‚ÄúIt's really changing the entire supply chain of the industry... It's not the same as going to a supplier and saying, oh, I want five or 10 of that over a period of 18 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's saying, no, I want 650 or 1,000 of those.‚Äù
OneWeb currently has filings at the ITU for up to 6,000 satellites.
‚ÄúIt's a scale game. It's a scale game for SpaceX, for us, for Amazon ( AMZN ).‚Äù

35,Tesla,Tesla (TSLA) earnings Q3 2019,"VIDEO 5:24 05:24 Tesla shares surge after strong earnings and delivery numbers ‚Äî Watch five experts debate the stock Trading Nation Tesla delivered a strong third-quarter earnings report after the bell on Wednesday, posting a surprise profit and telling shareholders it is ahead of schedule with a new factory in Shanghai. Shares spiked more than 20% after hours, putting them at their highest price since February.
Here's what the results were versus analysts' expectations:
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 vs. expected losses of 42 cents per share Revenue of $6.3 billion, vs. expected $6.33 billion, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates The electric car maker gave investors plenty to look forward to next year. It released a glossy 28-page investor update filled with photos from its new factory in Shanghai where Tesla said it's already begun trial production runs.
The company also said it was ahead of schedule on its long-awaited Model Y crossover, which it now expects to launch by next summer. At the same time, Tesla says it is planning to make a limited run of its Tesla Semi truck next year, and hopes to soon announce the location of its European Gigafactory, where it aims to begin making electric vehicles in 2021.
A photograph of the new Tesla paint shop in the Shanghai Gigafactory provided by the company in its Q3 2019 earnings release. Tesla In its Q3 2019 Update, Tesla said:
""Gigafactory Shanghai was built in 10 months and is ready for production, while it was ~65% less expensive (capex per unit of capacity) to build than our Model 3 production system in the US.""
A photo of general assembly in Tesla's new Shanghai Gigafactory, provided by the company with its Q3 2019 earnings release. Tesla Last quarter , Tesla shares dropped after the company reported losses of $1.12 per share and $6.35 billion in revenue. At this time last year, Tesla reported a ""historic"" third quarter with revenue of $6.82 billion and earnings per share of $2.90.
In Q3, Tesla released over-the-air software updates , including a controversial Smart Summon feature , that lets some Tesla drivers use an app to remotely call and control their cars. The cars can, in some situations, come pick them up from a short distance away, navigating a parking lot without any driver behind the wheel to do so.
Margins will be in sharp focus on today's earnings call, in part, because Tesla launched new Autopilot software upgrades which enabled the company to recognize deferred revenues. The company has been selling more, lower-priced Model 3 vehicles in 2019, and fewer of its higher-priced Model S and Model X's.
The company said in its Q3 2019 report: ""Despite reductions in the average selling price (ASP) of Model 3 as global mix stabilizes, our gross margins have strengthened.""
Specifically, automotive gross margins for Tesla rose to 22.8% in the third quarter, up from Q2 auto gross margins of 18.9%, but still less than the 25.8% automotive gross margins Tesla reported during the third quarter last year. Tesla said that margins were improved in part through ""Smart Summon-related deferred revenue recognition, FX and other non-recurring items."" It did not specify what the non-recurring items were.
Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn said on an earnings call on Wednesday afternoon that the company recognized $30 million in revenue related to the Smart Summon update.
Today's third-quarter earnings report is the first for Tesla since the departure of co-founder and former CTO JB Straubel, and since the company completed the acquisition of two companies: A computer vision startup called DeepScal e, and a battery manufacturing firm called Hibar Systems .

36,Tesla,Tesla will finally reveal its electric pickup truck - CNN,"The long-awaited Tesla pickup truck will finally be unveiled on Nov. 21 near the SpaceX rocket factory in Los Angeles, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced on Twitter .
Musk says Tesla's pickup will cost under $50,000 and be better than the F-150 Musk has said the electric truck, which was first announced in 2013, will have a starting price of less than $50,000. He has also claimed it will be a better truck than a Ford F-150 and a better sports car than a Porsche 911. It is not entirely clear, however, if those attributes can be expected in one version of the truck or if customers will be able to choose one or two out of the three: price, performance and/or hauling. The design of the truck is likely to be off-putting to many traditional pickup buyers, Musk has warned. A teaser image released by Tesla shows a line of light coming out of what appears to be the truck's hood. A teaser photo released by Tesla in March doesn't reveal much about the truck's design. Pickup trucks are the best-selling vehicles in America. The Ford F-series, in particular, has been the number one selling vehicle in America for more than 40 years. Pickup truck buyers are famously loyal to their favorite brands of trucks, though. Japanese automakers, Toyota and Nissan, both produce full-size trucks that compete with those from Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler, but neither has made significant inroads against their Michigan-based rivals in the US market. Ford shows off electric F-150 pickup by towing a freight train Ford ( F ) is also working on an all-electric F-150. Shortly after Musk said the Tesla truck would be ""better than an F-150,"" Ford released a video showing a prototype electric F-150 pulling a line of freight train cars weighing over 1 million pounds. Read More General Motors ( GM ) , too, is working on an electric pickup. Another Michigan-based company, Rivian, is also coming out with an electric pickup targeted at off-road and camping enthusiasts. Ford is a major investor in Rivian . While pickup enthusiasts are brand loyal and may prefer to stick with well-established truck makers, like GM's Chevrolet and Fiat Chrysler's ( FCAU ) Ram, Tesla has more experience making electric vehicles and could be a real competitor, said Michael Harley, an auto analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Ford invests $500 million in electric pickup truck maker Rivian ""If I were the Big Three truck makers at this point, I would be concerned,"" said Harley. ""Because, remember, nobody ever expected Elon Musk's Model 3 to disrupt BMW Audi, and those guys, you know, now it's outselling all three of those brands."" Truck buyers are very different from luxury car buyers, though, Harley said. The most likely outcome, he said, is that Tesla will sell some trucks but not seriously threaten the domination of Ford, Ram and Chevrolet.",2019-11-08T02:00:00.000+02:00,cnn.com,long|*|await|*|tesla|*|pickup|*|truck|*|finally|*|unveil|*|near|*|spacex|*|rocket|*|factory|*|los_angeles|*|tesla|*|ceo_elon|*|musk|*|announce|*|twitter|*|musk|*|tesla|*|pickup|*|cost|*|musk|*|electric|*|truck|*|announce|*|starting|*|price|*|-pron-|*|claim|*|-pron-|*|truck|*|ford|*|sport|*|car|*|porsche|*|-pron-|*|entirely|*|clear|*|attribute|*|expect|*|version|*|truck|*|customer|*|able|*|choose|*|price|*|performance|*|haul|*|design|*|truck|*|likely|*|traditional|*|pickup|*|buyer|*|musk|*|warn|*|teaser|*|image|*|release|*|tesla|*|line|*|light|*|come|*|appear|*|truck|*|hood|*|teaser|*|photo|*|release|*|tesla|*|march|*|reveal|*|truck|*|design|*|pickup|*|truck|*|sell|*|vehicle|*|america|*|ford|*|f|*|series|*|particular|*|number|*|sell|*|vehicle|*|america|*|year|*|pickup|*|truck|*|buyer|*|famously|*|loyal|*|-pron-|*|favorite|*|brand|*|truck|*|japanese|*|automaker|*|toyota|*|nissan|*|produce|*|size|*|truck|*|compete|*|ford|*|gm|*|fiat|*|chrysler|*|significant|*|inroad|*|-pron-|*|michigan|*|base|*|rival|*|market|*|ford|*|electric|*|pickup|*|tow|*|freight|*|train|*|ford|*|f|*|work|*|electric|*|shortly|*|musk|*|tesla|*|truck|*|ford|*|release|*|video|*|prototype|*|electric|*|pull|*|line|*|freight|*|train|*|car|*|weigh|*|million|*|pound|*|read|*|general|*|motors|*|gm|*|work|*|electric|*|pickup|*|michigan|*|base|*|company|*|rivian|*|come|*|electric|*|pickup|*|target|*|road|*|camping|*|enthusiast|*|ford|*|major|*|investor|*|rivian|*|pickup|*|enthusiast|*|brand|*|loyal|*|prefer|*|stick|*|establish|*|truck|*|maker|*|like|*|gm|*|chevrolet|*|fiat|*|chrysler|*|fcau|*|ram|*|tesla|*|experience|*|electric_vehicle|*|real|*|competitor|*|michael|*|harley|*|auto|*|analyst|*|kelley|*|blue|*|book|*|ford|*|invest|*|million|*|electric|*|pickup|*|truck|*|maker|*|rivian|*|-pron-|*|big|*|truck|*|maker|*|point|*|-pron-|*|concern|*|harley|*|remember|*|expect|*|elon_musk|*|model|*|disrupt|*|bmw|*|audi|*|guy|*|-pron-|*|know|*|-pron-|*|outsell|*|brand|*|truck|*|buyer|*|different|*|luxury|*|car|*|buyer|*|harley|*|likely|*|outcome|*|-pron-|*|tesla|*|sell|*|truck|*|seriously|*|threaten|*|domination|*|ford|*|ram|*|chevrolet
37,Tesla,Former Yugloslavia's brutalist beauty ‚Äì a photo essay | Art and design | The Guardian,"Socialist Yugoslavia reconstructed a land destroyed by fighting with concrete to show the power of a state between eastern and western power. G enex Tower is unmissable on the highway from Belgrade airport to the centre of the city. Its two soaring blocks, connected by an aerial bridge and topped with a long-closed rotating restaurant resembling a space capsule, are such an unusual sight, the 1977-build tower has become a magnet for tourists despite years of neglect. The tower is one of the most significant examples of brutalism ‚Äì an architectural style popular in the 1950s and 1960s, based on crude, block-like forms cast from concrete.
Genex Tower, also known as the Western City gate, in Belgrade, Serbia .
Brutalism was popular throughout the eastern bloc but the former Yugoslavia made it its own ‚Äì seizing on it as a way to forge a visual identity poised between east and west. Interest in the style is soaring ‚Äì particularly since a 2018 exhibition in New York‚Äôs Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) called Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980 .
Top: Karaburma Housing Tower, also known as the Toblerone building, in Belgrade, Serbia; Above: the Eastern City Gate apartment buildings complex in the Konjarnik neighbourhood of Belgrade
‚ÄúWe have dozens of people every week interested in taking our Yugo tour around city landmarks built from the 1950s to 1980s,‚Äù says Vojin Muncin, manager of the Yugotour sightseeing agency which guides tourists around the Serbian capital in Yugos, the former Yugoslavia‚Äôs once ubiquitous car. ‚ÄúGenex Tower is among the most interesting sight. People see it on their way from the airport and it immediately draws their attention.‚Äù Today one of the pillars is empty, while the other is residential. The rotating restaurant was last open in the 1990s.
Above: laundry hangs out to dry inside Block 23, New Belgrade. Right: A staircase in Block 11; garage doors in Block 23. Below: Windows face out of the building, known as the ‚ÄúTV building‚Äù, a facade in Block 28.
After the second world war, socialist Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito set out to reconstruct a land destroyed by fighting. Initially allied to the Soviet Union, Tito broke with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1948. Residential blocks, hotels, civic centres and monuments all made of concrete shot up across the country. The architecture was supposed to show the power of a state between two worlds ‚Äì western democracy and the communist east, looking to forge its own path and create a socialist utopia.
But after Tito died in 1980, and economic crisis took hold, the new elites sought to distance themselves from the socialist regime, including its architecture. In 1991 the series of wars began that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia.

‚ÄúNow enough time has passed (since Yugoslavia fell apart) and people have begun to appreciate the architecture of Yugoslavia,‚Äù says Alan Braun, lecturer at Zagreb University‚Äôs architecture faculty. He explains that the style was unique because of its visible influence from the west, reflecting Yugoslavia‚Äôs unique position. Residential areas were planned to have enough parks, cinemas, swimming pools and even parking space.
Keen to capitalise on the interest, Belgrade authorities are now considering opening parts of another masterpiece of Yugoslav brutalism ‚Äì the Palata Srbija (Palace of Serbia) government building, which is currently only open once a year.

The Palata Srbija building hosted former world leaders such as US presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Russian leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Each of the former Yugoslav republics had its own salon with a central room called the hall of Yugoslavia.

Furniture and carpets were custom made and prominent artists produced paintings and mosaics. The outside of the building is concrete, but the inside is marble. Its centrepiece is a crystal chandelier beneath a 19-metre dome weighing more than nine tonnes. ‚ÄúIt is a shame to keep such a master piece away from the eyes of the public,‚Äù said Sandra Vesic Tesla, curator of the building.
The Monument to the Uprising of the People of Kordun and Banija in Petrova Gora, Croatia
Other examples of Yugoslav brutalism include the huge memorials commemorating the struggle against fascism by Tito‚Äôs partisans, often placed in dramatic rural settings. Many of those pieces of art remain in disrepair, such as the monument to the uprising against fascism in Petrova Gora in Croatia.
However, the Tjentiste memorial, commemorating the killing of 7,000 people by the Nazis was renovated last year. Miodrag Zivkovic, the 91-year-old sculptor of the 19-metre-high concrete Tjentiste memorial, was among the first artists in the former Yugoslavia to use concrete.
‚ÄúIt is stable material, resembling stone but it is easier to work with,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor every project back in those days there was a national contest, and artists from all over the country had the opportunity to apply, and that competition produced quality.‚Äù

39,Tesla,"Zoox cofounder Jesse Levinson says there‚Äôs ‚Äòno chance‚Äô Tesla will launch fully self-driving cars next year, despite Elon Musk‚Äôs claims","Zoox cofounder and CTO Jesse Levinson said he thinks there&apos;s no chance Tesla will have fully self-driving cars with no human interaction ready next year, which Elon Musk has claimed. Zoox is also a self-driving car startup, but unlike Tesla, it is developing autonomous vehicles specifically meant for ride-hailing, rather than for individual ownership. Levinson spoke during Business Insider&apos;s IGNITION: Transportation live event in San Francisco on Tuesday. Visit Business Insider&apos;s homepage for more stories. When asked if there&apos;s ""any chance"" that Tesla will have fully self-driving cars ready next year as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has claimed, Zoox cofounder and CTO Jesse Levinson had a one-word answer: ""No.""
Speaking with transportation reporter Mark Matousek on stage at Business Insider&apos;s IGNITION: Transportation event in San Francisco Tuesday, Levinson said that the existing technology for fully autonomous vehicles simply doesn&apos;t exist yet ‚Äî it&apos;s something that both Tesla and Zoox, a startup designing autonomous ride-share vehicles, are still developing.
Musk said in April that, by mid-2020, Teslas will be capable of fully autonomous driving, meaning drivers wouldn&apos;t even have to look at the road while riding. While Tesla currently offers autopilot mode for driving on the freeway, its cars are not capable of driving on city streets without driver oversight.
""They don&apos;t have enough sensors or computers to do that given any remotely known technology that exists that humans have ever created,"" Levinson said. ""And by the way they&apos;re great cars, the [Tesla autopilot system ] on the freeway is I think the best out there ... I think if [Musk] focused on that aspect it would be better received.""
A Tesla spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
During the interview, Levinson touted the progress being made in self-driving car software and hardware across the industry. He also said that Zoox has differentiated itself from the competition by extensively testing self-driving cars on city streets, rather than quiet suburban roads.
""The reality is the societal need for this technology and economic need for this technology is insidious, it doesn&apos;t just exist in suburbs,"" Levinson said.
Zoox, which was most recently valued at $3.2 billion , hopes to release a fleet of self-driving rideshare vehicles that users will be able to hail with a mobile app by 2021. Right now, its primary challenge is ensuring its autonomous vehicles are safe to avoid car crash deaths that have resulted from self-driving car tests by Uber and Tesla .
""The status quo is almost 45,000 Americans are dying every year in car crashes,"" Levinson said. ""But if you rush the technology ‚Ä¶ society&apos;s not going to accept that, and I dont think they should.""

40,Tesla,Elon Musk: Tesla solar roof version 3 coming this week - Business Insider,"Elon Musk showing off an earlier version of Tesla's solar-roof panel. Tesla Tesla will announce ""version three"" of its solar roof product on Thursday, CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday. He made the announcement during the company's third-quarter earnings call following a surprise profit for the quarter , blowing past Wall Street's estimates. Earlier this year, Walmart sued Tesla, accusing its other solar-panel products of causing fires at seven stores. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .
Tesla plans to unveil a third version of its solar-roof product, CEO Elon Musk said on the company's third-quarter earnings conference call Wednesday evening.
""Tomorrow afternoon we will be releasing version three of the Tesla solar roof,"" the CEO said at the end of his prepared remarks. ""I think this is a great product. Versions one and two we were still figuring things out ‚Äî version three is finally ready for the big time.""
Tesla's other solar-energy product, its more traditional solar panels, are under fierce scrutiny following a lawsuit from Walmart. The retailer claims Tesla's solar panels caught fire on the roofs of seven stores across the US. Tesla has not responded to requests for comment about the suit since it was filed but is required to respond to Walmart by Friday.
""There's no money down and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract,"" Musk said later on the call, in which Tesla also announced a surprise profit for the quarter , blowing past Wall Street's estimates. ""It's really a no-brainer. Do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or take it back.""
Musk also pointed to a recently released study by Zillow , a real-estate website, that said solar panels increased home values by about 4%.
Since Walmart's suit was filed, Business Insider reported the existence of a Tesla initiative called Project Titan . The move sought to replace as many faulty Amphenol connectors in previously installed solar equipment as quickly ‚Äî and quietly ‚Äî as possible.
Tesla told Business Insider at the time that its software-monitoring applications found that a ""small number"" of the connectors experienced failures and disconnections higher than their standards allowed.

41,Tesla,"Tesla only makes Model S, Model X for 'sentimental reasons': Elon Musk - Business Insider","Hollis Johnson Elon Musk says Tesla's only making the Model S and X for ""sentimental reasons."" The comments come as the company looks to its new Model Y, and continued sales of its Model 3 sedan. ""They're really niche products,"" he said. ""I mean, they're very expensive, made in low volume."" Tesla on Thursday reported a surprise third-quarter profit that blew past Wall Street earnings estimates. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .
Tesla's two most expensive cars are only being made for ""sentimental reasons,"" Elon Musk said Wednesday.
""The Model S and X are really niche,"" the CEO said on Tesla's third-quarter earnings call, after the company handily topped Wall Street's financial estimates for the period.
""They're really niche products,"" he continued. ""I mean, they're very expensive, made in low volume. To be totally frank, we're continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. They're really of minor importance to the future.""
The statement aligns somewhat with Musk's public statements about Tesla's Model 3 being the company's flagship product for the years to come.
Musk also hinted at big plans for the company's forthcoming Model Y crossover on the call, saying he now expects to reach full production of 1,000 units per week in the summer of 2020 instead of the fall as originally planned.
Despite the lack of enthusiasm from Musk on the Model S and X, CFO Zach Kirkhorn clarified that Tesla is ""increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand.""
""I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that's kind of consumed a lot of the attention around the company,"" he said. ""But now as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3.""

42,Tesla,Gas Station Converts To Electric Charging Station And Speeds Ahead Of Curve,"Enlarge this image Depeswar Doley's RS Automotive in Takoma Park, Md., is the first U.S. gas station to be fully converted to an electric vehicle charging center. Mhari Shaw/NPR hide caption

Mhari Shaw/NPR Updated at 8:06 p.m. ET
The electric car industry is expanding, and at least one business owner is capitalizing on that growth. RS Automotive ‚Äî the first U.S. gas station fully converted to an electric vehicle-charging station ‚Äî opened a month ago in Takoma Park, Md.
A brand new blue and white sign reads EV charging, replacing where the dollar and cents gas price listings stood. From afar, the station's electric chargers don't look too different from their predecessors. Some drivers still think they can still fill up their gas tanks here.
""A lot of them pull up and get upset,"" says owner Depeswar Doley.
Business As More Electric Cars Arrive, What's The Future For Gas-Powered Engines? The honks, screeches and vrooms of morning traffic are going strong during a recent visit to the station, but Doley says business has been slow. Over the past week, there have been about eight to 12 charging sessions per day, according to Matthew Wade, CEO of the Electric Vehicle Institute.
Still, interest is growing.
Every week, Doley fields calls from gas station owners who are considering replacing their pumps with chargers. Others are EV enthusiasts wanting to visit the station, some hailing from as far as Maine.
There are about 40 types of electric cars people can buy right now, Dan Bowermaster, with the Electric Power Research Institute says, but within four years, there will be closer to 120 on the market.
""Not only is that a much bigger number than what's on the road today,"" says Bowermaster, ""but a third of those will be crossovers and SUVs, and that's what we Americans are buying.""

Mhari Shaw/NPR Doley is willing to wait. He has owned the independent station and repair shop since 1997. After 20 years of bad contracts, changeable oil prices and convenience store break-ins, Doley says he decided to shut off the gas pumps. He took out a personal loan out to remove the station's underground storage tanks. The plan was to just keep the repair shop open.
Then, Doley got a call from the city: Would he want to transform the station into a fully outfitted charging center? The offer came with a $786,000 grant to pay for the conversion ‚Äî a combination of state funding and money from the Baltimore-based Electric Vehicle Institute.
His 17-year-old daughter, Teresa, pushed him to take the leap. She hopes the station eases drivers charging anxieties.
""I think it's kind of encouraging people to get EVs, a lot of people don't want to get electric vehicles, because they're worried that they're not going to be able to charge them,"" the teenager says. ""And I think that if you make it more available, then people are more likely to want to try it.""
As more and more affordable EVs roll out in the next few years, there will be more demand for public charging centers, Bowermaster says.
Business Tesla Led The Charge, But More Premium Electric Vehicles Are Arriving ""There's definitely a very real need to to have these DC fast-charging centers,"" says Bowermaster, ""whether it's for [low-income], for lower-income customers, or for fleets or for those who live in a townhouse, where they just simply don't have a garage with 120-volt or 240-volt outlets.""
Most electric cars on the roads today store up to 50 kilowatt-hours of power, explains Wade of the Electric Vehicle Institute. But EVs coming out of companies such as GM and Volkswagen in the next few years will accept up to 200 kWh, so Doley's station is ""future-proof,"" Wade says.
Montgomery County in Maryland has one of the highest rates of EVs on the road, and in January, state utilities got approval to install a network of more than 5,000 charging stations over the next five years.
For Doley, that might mean more and more charging profits down the line. But for now, it seems electric taxis and police cars are the most frequent customers.

Mhari Shaw/NPR Doley also revamped the station's former convenience store and turned it into a charging lounge, with black leather easy chairs and Wi-Fi. He says he doesn't want to sell food in the lounge. That's in part to encourage drivers to wander around the neighborhood while their car charges, which takes around 15 to 30 minutes.
Ramon Dawes who runs Roland's Unisex Barbershop next door to RS Automotive hasn't noticed a difference in his customer base yet.
""But it's a learning curve,"" Dawes says. ""Got to do something. Save the planet, one step at a time.""
Doley gets 66% of the revenue from charging sessions, while EVI, gets 33%. The current charging price is a base of $2.50 plus $0.20 per minute. Doley pays to keep the power flowing, and EVI pays to keep the chargers maintained.
A month after the business opened, Doley remains optimistic.
""If I can spread that one word around, that one little drop, if I can contribute for the betterment of the environment and Earth in general, and for us, humanity, that's more than enough,"" Doley says. ""That's a better reward than the money.""

43,Tesla,"Man fatally burned in fiery Tesla crash after high-tech door wouldn't open, lawsuit alleges - ABC News","The widow of a father of five in Florida is suing Tesla after her late husband was burned alive in a Model S when the electronic door handles wouldn't open during a fiery crash, according to court documents. Interested in Tesla? Add Tesla as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Tesla news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Tesla Add Interest Omar Awan, a 48-year-old anesthesiologist, died on Feb. 24 after his Tesla Model S veered out of control on a parkway and struck a palm tree. A police officer who witnessed the accident immediately rushed to help, court documents stated.
""The police officer tried to open the doors of the Awan Tesla but the door handles were retracted, and did not 'auto-present' when he approached,"" according to the complaint filed earlier this month. ""The sleek design of the Model S doors eliminates anything that can be pulled or opened until the recessed handles become available.""
(MORE: Tesla's Autopilot was engaged before fatal Florida crash: NTSB) The automaker's website touts the electric door handles as part of its design meant for ""incredible aerodynamics, ludicrous performance and uncompromised aesthetics.""
""Automatic door handles auto-present upon approach and withdraw when closed,"" the website states.
As the car caught fire and flames spread, the complaint alleges the Tesla's doors and door handles ""remained inaccessible and locked.""
Smoke soon engulfed the entire car, ""while the police officer and bystanders helplessly watched,"" the complaint added.
""After the Tesla hit the tree, he was alive. He had no internal injuries or broken bones,"" the complaint states. ""He died from the smoke he inhaled as he sat locked inside the Tesla, despite that a police officer and others were there and ready to help, until flames forced them away.""
David Zalubowski/AP, FILE
A Tesla Model S sedan charges at a supercharging station in Silverthorne, Colo. on June 8, 2019. Attorney Stuart Grossman, who is representing Awan's widow and family in the lawsuit, described him and his wife as ""intelligent, environmentally-conscious people who wanted to have a Tesla"" until it ended in a ""bizarre tragedy.""
""It was just a horrible death,"" Grossman told ABC News. ""He was burned beyond recognition.""
(MORE: Tesla sued for 'defective' Autopilot in wrongful death suit of Florida driver who crashed into tractor trailer) Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Thursday morning.
Shortly after the crash in February, the automaker released a statement to the Florida Sun-Sentinel saying they were cooperating with local authorities.
‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened by this accident and our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy,"" the company told the local paper. ‚ÄúWe have reached out to the local authorities to offer our cooperation. We understand that speed is being investigated as a factor in this crash, and know that high speed collisions can result in a fire in any type of car, not just electric vehicles.‚Äù
On their website , Tesla describes the Model S as ""one of the safest cars on the road.""
""Much of its safety is owed to the unique electric drivetrain that sits beneath the car,"" the company added, claiming it has set a record ""of lowest likelihood of injury to occupants when tested in the United States.""

44,Tesla,What is fatFIRE vs. leanFIRE? 2 different ways to retire early - Business Insider,"Foto: TommL/Getty The FIRE movement is largely a numbers game. Financial independence, retire early (FIRE) is often broken down into three categories: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses and lives on a ‚Äúlean‚Äù budget, spending less than the average American. By contrast, someone who achieves FatFIRE spends more than the average person. Regular FIRE is someone whose spending is in line with the average US household, around $60,000 a year. Pursuing a fatFIRE number ‚Äì regardless of how much you actually plan to spend ‚Äì can afford greater flexibility, freedom, and protection in early retirement . Read more personal finance coverage. The FIRE (financial independence, retire early) movement is largely a numbers game. The formula is simple: A person needs to save up and invest 25 times their annual spending in order to become financially independent , assuming they plan to withdraw 4% of their nest egg each year thereafter. At that point, they no longer need to rely on a paycheck coming in to afford their lifestyle and they have the freedom to retire early . There are a few variables at play, but the largest one in this formula is spending. How much you spend can vary drastically depending on the size of your family, where you live, what you do in your free time, and so much more. One woman may want to be able to retire early on $100,000 a year in New York City, while a couple in the rural Midwest is happy living on $40,000 a year. As such, their target numbers will be wildly different. To explain these variations, the online FIRE community categorizes early retirement in three ways: FIRE, leanFIRE, and fatFIRE. What is leanFIRE vs. fatFIRE? The average US household spends about $61,000 a year, according to Census data . LeanFIRE is when someone has saved up 25 times their annual expenses ‚Äì the traditional benchmark for financial independence ‚Äì and spends less each year than the average American. Dit verandert er in de basisverzekering in 2020: stoppen met roken goedkoper en meer zorg voor ouderen en verstandelijk gehandicapten vergoed FatFIRE, by contrast, is when someone who has reached financial independence spends more than average. Using the example above, the New Yorker would be pursuing fatFIRE, since she‚Äôs living on $100,000 a year. Ultimately she‚Äôd need $2.5 million invested before leaving work to maintain the same standard of living in early retirement ($100,000 x 25 years). Meanwhile, the Midwestern couple lives on far less than the typical household, so they‚Äôd be considered leanFIRE and would only need $1 million ($40,000 x 25 years) to retire early. In other words, they‚Äôre frugal. ‚ÄúFatFIRE is early retirement for the entrepreneurs and high-income professionals that choose not to fully embrace frugality or give up certain creature comforts that have become customary. It‚Äôs financial independence for the well-heeled,‚Äù explains Leif Dahleen, a former anesthesiologist who retired at age 43 , in a post on his blog , PhysicianOnFIRE. ‚ÄúWhereas plain vanilla FIRE and leanFIRE may require certain choices ‚Äì I would never call them sacrifices ‚Äì fatFIRE allows those who have undergone some lifestyle inflation and have spent some time on life‚Äôs hedonic treadmill to maintain that particular standard of living,‚Äù Dahleen writes. FatFIRE may offer more flexibility in early retirement There are benefits and drawbacks to both leanFIRE and fatFIRE. Some, including Dahleen, argue that pursuing a fatFIRE number ‚Äì regardless of how much you spend in the present ‚Äì can afford greater flexibility, freedom, and even protection from unexpected events in early retirement. ‚ÄúWith a fatFIRE portfolio, you can do things others can‚Äôt afford to do, at least not as often,‚Äù Dahleen writes. ‚ÄúYou can travel regularly during the high season, even flying first class if it suits you. You can pick up a Tesla or an Acura NSX because you want one and you know it won‚Äôt derail your FIRE plan.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúYou also have a better ability to trim the fat when times are tough. If our economy hits a stormy patch and stock values plummet, who‚Äôs got more discretionary spending in the budget to cut? That‚Äôs right, the fatFIRE family.‚Äù Ultimately, it‚Äôs up to you to decide how you want your lifestyle to look in early retirement and how much it will cost. If you want some wiggle room, you may choose to aim for fatFIRE figures. If you‚Äôre ready to leave work as soon as possible and are prepared to live frugally, or you have passive income streams set up, the quickest route to early retirement is probably leanFIRE.",2019-11-04T02:00:00.000+02:00,businessinsider.com,foto|*|tomml|*|getty|*|fire|*|movement|*|largely|*|number|*|game|*|financial|*|independence|*|retire|*|early|*|fire|*|break|*|category|*|fire|*|leanfire|*|fatfire|*|leanfire|*|save|*|time|*|-pron-|*|annual|*|expense|*|life|*|lean|*|budget|*|spend|*|average|*|american|*|contrast|*|achieve|*|fatfire|*|spend|*|average|*|person|*|regular|*|fire|*|spending|*|line|*|average|*|household|*|year|*|pursue|*|fatfire|*|number|*|regardless|*|-pron-|*|actually|*|plan|*|spend|*|afford|*|great|*|flexibility|*|freedom|*|protection|*|early_retirement|*|read|*|personal|*|finance|*|coverage|*|fire|*|financial|*|independence|*|retire|*|early|*|movement|*|largely|*|number|*|game|*|formula|*|simple|*|person|*|need|*|save|*|invest|*|time|*|-pron-|*|annual|*|spending|*|order|*|financially|*|independent|*|assume|*|-pron-|*|plan|*|withdraw|*|-pron-|*|nest|*|egg|*|year|*|point|*|-pron-|*|longer|*|need|*|rely|*|paycheck|*|come|*|afford|*|-pron-|*|lifestyle|*|-pron-|*|freedom|*|retire|*|early|*|variable|*|play|*|large|*|formula|*|spend|*|-pron-|*|spend|*|vary|*|drastically|*|depend|*|size|*|-pron-|*|family|*|-pron-|*|live|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|free|*|time|*|woman|*|want|*|able|*|retire|*|early|*|year|*|new_york|*|city|*|couple|*|rural|*|midwest|*|happy|*|live|*|year|*|-pron-|*|target|*|number|*|wildly|*|different|*|explain|*|variation|*|online|*|fire|*|community|*|categorize|*|early_retirement|*|way|*|fire|*|leanfire|*|fatfire|*|leanfire|*|fatfire|*|average|*|household|*|spend|*|year|*|accord|*|census|*|datum|*|leanfire|*|save|*|time|*|-pron-|*|annual|*|expense|*|traditional|*|benchmark|*|financial|*|independence|*|spend|*|year|*|average|*|american|*|dit|*|verandert|*|er|*|de|*|basisverzekere|*|stoppen|*|meet|*|roken|*|goedkoper|*|en|*|meer|*|zorg|*|voor|*|ouderen|*|en|*|verstandelijk|*|gehandicapten|*|vergoed|*|fatfire|*|contrast|*|reach|*|financial|*|independence|*|spend|*|average|*|use|*|example|*|new|*|yorker|*|pursue|*|fatfire|*|-pron-|*|live|*|year|*|ultimately|*|-pron-|*|need|*|million|*|invest|*|leave|*|work|*|maintain|*|standard|*|live|*|early_retirement|*|x|*|year|*|midwestern|*|couple|*|live|*|far|*|typical|*|household|*|-pron-|*|consider|*|leanfire|*|need|*|million|*|x|*|year|*|retire|*|early|*|word|*|-pron-|*|frugal|*|fatfire|*|early_retirement|*|entrepreneur|*|high|*|income|*|professional|*|choose|*|fully|*|embrace|*|frugality|*|certain|*|creature|*|comfort|*|customary|*|-pron-|*|financial|*|independence|*|heel|*|explain|*|leif|*|dahleen|*|anesthesiologist|*|retire|*|age|*|post|*|-pron-|*|blog|*|physicianonfire|*|plain|*|vanilla|*|fire|*|leanfire|*|require|*|certain|*|choice|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|sacrifice|*|fatfire|*|allow|*|undergo|*|lifestyle|*|inflation|*|spend|*|time|*|life|*|hedonic|*|treadmill|*|maintain|*|particular|*|standard|*|living|*|dahleen|*|write|*|fatfire|*|offer|*|flexibility|*|early_retirement|*|benefit|*|drawback|*|leanfire|*|fatfire|*|include|*|dahleen|*|argue|*|pursue|*|fatfire|*|number|*|regardless|*|-pron-|*|spend|*|present|*|afford|*|great|*|flexibility|*|freedom|*|protection|*|unexpected|*|event|*|early_retirement|*|fatfire|*|portfolio|*|-pron-|*|thing|*|afford|*|dahleen|*|write|*|-pron-|*|travel|*|regularly|*|high|*|season|*|fly|*|class|*|-pron-|*|suit|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|pick|*|tesla|*|acura|*|nsx|*|-pron-|*|want|*|-pron-|*|know|*|-pron-|*|derail|*|-pron-|*|fire|*|plan|*|-pron-|*|continue|*|-pron-|*|ability|*|trim|*|fat|*|time|*|tough|*|-pron-|*|economy|*|hit|*|stormy|*|patch|*|stock|*|value|*|plummet|*|discretionary|*|spending|*|budget|*|cut|*|right|*|fatfire|*|family|*|ultimately|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|decide|*|-pron-|*|want|*|-pron-|*|lifestyle|*|look|*|early_retirement|*|-pron-|*|cost|*|-pron-|*|want|*|wiggle|*|room|*|-pron-|*|choose|*|aim|*|fatfire|*|figure|*|-pron-|*|ready|*|leave|*|work|*|soon|*|possible|*|prepared|*|live|*|frugally|*|-pron-|*|passive|*|income|*|stream|*|set|*|quick|*|route|*|early_retirement|*|probably|*|leanfire
45,Tesla,Walmart drops Tesla suit which claimed its solar panels caused fires - Business Insider,"Solar panels on the roof of a Sam's Club in Glendora, California. David McNew/Getty Images Walmart has dropped its lawsuit against Tesla , which accused the company's solar panels of causing fires at seven stores. Tesla engaged in ""widespread negligence"" as it installed more than 200 systems at Walmart stores nationwide, the original complaint said. A Walmart representative said the two companies had reached a settlement outside of the court to drop the suit and reenergize the systems.
Walmart has dropped its lawsuit that claimed Tesla solar panels caught fire on the roof of seven stores throughout the United States.
According to a court filing from Monday , Walmart's complaint was ""voluntarily discontinued without prejudice"" to Tesla.
A Walmart spokesperson said that the two companies had reached a settlement outside of the court, but provided no details on that agreement. A final court approval of the settlement and case dismissal is expected soon.
The company plans to reenergize its 240 solar systems as part of the agreement, the representative said.
""Walmart and Tesla are pleased to have resolved the issues raised by Walmart concerning the Tesla solar installations at Walmart stores,"" the companies said in a joint statement. ""Safety is a top priority for each company and with the concerns being addressed, we both look forward to a safe re-energization of our sustainable energy systems.""
Shares of Tesla spiked about 1.5% when the filing was made public Tuesday morning. The company did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
In August, when the retail giant's lawsuit was originally filed, it said the fires were a result of Tesla's ""widespread negligence"" as it installed systems on more than 200 stores, all of which had been switched off after the fires.
""Tesla has also demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to remediate the dangerous conditions documented in its inspection reports,"" the complaint said.
In the wake of the lawsuit, Amazon said that Tesla panels had also caught fire on the roof of one of its fulfillment centers in Redlands, California, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles. A spokesperson said at the time that Amazon had no further plans for more Tesla solar projects beyond its existing 11.
In the summer of 2018, Tesla quietly launched ""Project Titan"" to replace defective solar-panel parts . Specifically, Tesla was replacing connectors and optimizers, parts that are meant to regulate the amount of energy flowing to a solar panel. Too much energy can cause a fire.
In response to the program being reported publicly, Tesla said that less than 1% of sites with the connectors had ""exhibited any abnormal behavior.""

46,Tesla,Honda to stop producing gasoline-only vehicles by 2022 | Business News | Sky News,"Honda has announced plans to stop producing gasoline-only cars by 2022.
The carmaker said it will ""electrify"" all of its models sold in Europe within the next three years - which includes making many models hybrid.
Hybrid vehicles carry a traditional internal combustion engine as well as a battery pack.
The Japanese company has brought forward its original plan to move away from petrol-only and diesel-only vehicles by three years from its previously announced target of 2025.
Speaking from Amsterdam to Sky News' Ian King Live, the company's senior vice president for Europe, Tom Gardner, said the decision will considerably change the line-up of cars it offers.
Advertisement He said: ""Honda is the world's largest engine manufacturer, and from what we have announced today we are committing to ending all mainstream non-electrified petrol and diesel production for Europe by the end of 2022.""

47,Tesla,Tesla to build first European factory in Berlin - BBC News,"'Berlin rocks,' says Elon Musk as he chooses European factory 13 November 2019 Share this with Twitter Share this with Whatsapp Video caption The lithium powering electric vehicles is found deep beneath the salt flats of Argentina Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said Berlin will be the site of its first major European factory as the carmaker's expansion plans power ahead. ""Berlin rocks,"" Mr Musk said, adding Tesla would build an engineering and design centre in the German capital. Tesla previously said it aimed to start production in Europe in 2021. The moves come as the firm, which has also invested heavily in a Chinese factory, faces intensifying competition in the electric vehicle industry. Mr Musk made the announcement at an awards ceremony in Germany on Tuesday. The company already has an assembly site in the Netherlands, but the plans for Germany are on a far larger scale. ""Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,"" he said. Mr Musk also cited risks surrounding the UK's exit from the EU for his decision, according to AutoExpress . ""Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK,"" he told the trade magazine. Mr Musk said the facility would be located near the new Berlin airport and later gave more details on what the factory would produce on Twitter. Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable. The focus on Germany comes amid rising appetite for electric cars in Europe. Over the coming years, the biggest electric car production plants will be in Germany, France, Spain and Italy, industry analysis shows. Some 16 large-scale lithium-ion battery cell plants are confirmed or due to begin operations in Europe by 2023. Elon Musk has long been pondering where to put his European facility known as a ""gigafactory"". Mr Musk's announcement on Tuesday night came ahead of the Prime Minister giving a televised election speech from an electric car factory. It has long been an aim of government policy to attract such a gigafactory to the UK, but international investors are yet to bite. The disruption of a possible no-deal Brexit has weighed down industry investment. But even the current deal proposed by the government would involve checks for customs and the origin of parts, that are difficult for the car industry and electric car industry in particular. While Mr Musk in 2014 expressed a long term desire to open a UK factory, that wasn't expected this soon. However, industry sources had been more hopeful that Mr Musk would choose the UK for his research and development facility in the UK. That too will be situated in Germany. Tesla's European plan comes as the carmaker also moves ahead with a $2bn (¬£1.6bn) factory in Shanghai. The firm is looking to ramp up production in China, the world's biggest car market, where sales have been hurt by tariffs triggered by the US-China trade war.

48,Tesla,Why Facebook's Libra has a friend in GOP Senator Mike Rounds,"Facebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg emerged from a grilling Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted him over plans to create a new cryptocurrency, among a host of other issues.
Yet despite the barrage of criticism, Zuckerberg does have at least one friend in the Senate. Recently, South Dakota Republican Mike Rounds wrote a letter to a Libra Association member, Anchorage Trust Company, urging them to ‚Äúpersevere‚Äù amid the backlash.
In recent weeks, as a number of high profile founding members have backed out of the controversial initiative , Rounds wrote that he was puzzled by the backlash ‚Äî adding that Libra has the ‚Äúpotential to benefit consumers across the globe.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat we're talking about is not trying to identify and pick a winner or loser, what we're saying is the concept of this cryptocurrency is for real and it's not going to go away,‚Äù said Rounds on Yahoo Finance‚Äôs ‚Äú YFi PM .‚Äù
UNITED STATES - Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) voiced support for Facebook's cryptocurrency project. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) More Rounds support for Libra stems from concerns that the U.S. will be left behind other countries when it comes to digital payments. He cited statistics from a Bain study that revealed more than 80% Chinese consumers used mobile payments last year, compared to a slim 10% in the U.S.
‚ÄúI think right now if you take a look at where China's at, where the entire continent of Africa is at with regard to mobile payments, you find that it is something in which other countries are skipping to a new technology in which transactions are being handled,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they're using cryptocurrency technology.‚Äù
The senator believes cryptocurrency helps make small and point-of-sale transactions become efficient and inexpensive.
‚ÄúSo I just don't think that the rest of the world should continue on this path with the United States and our consumers here not being able to benefit from those less expensive ways of doing business,‚Äù he said.
Widespread skepticism in Congress Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, to discuss his plans for the new cryptocurrency Libra. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) More
However, Rounds‚Äô bullishness isn‚Äôt shared by many of his Congressional colleagues, who pelted Zuckerberg on Wednesday with all sorts of pointed questions about Facebook‚Äôs crypto ambitions.
On Wednesday, Arkansas Rep. French Hill asked why the platform was using a basket of currencies to stabilize Libra, and why it wasn‚Äôt based in the U.S. instead of Geneva, Switzerland. Zuckerberg responded that Libra ‚Äúwould primarily be [based on] American dollars‚Äù
Rounds told Yahoo Finance that outdated U.S. regulation is stifling the balance between innovation and protecting consumers.
‚ÄúBased on the regulatory environment today that we have, we're really looking at a 1933 law‚Äù that governs financial transactions. Rounds added that given modern technological advances, ‚Äúwe need to upgrade it.‚Äù
The People‚Äôs Bank of China announced earlier this year that it was working on a digital currency backed by the yuan, taking after Facebook‚Äôs Libra announcement. It will be used by payment platforms like WeChat ( TCEHY ) and Alipay ( BABA ).
Rounds urged that the U.S. should not cede cryptocurrency leadership to China. He urged the U.S. to become more competitive in this space ‚Äî saying that it wasn‚Äôt about picking the winners and losers.
‚ÄúThis is an innovative approach - more than one will come in, but most certainly we shouldn't let it be created and innovated just in other parts of the world,‚Äù the senator said.
‚ÄúWe should play a part in that,‚Äù Rounds added.

50,alt-right,Video from 2018 shows water polo athletes at Pacifica High in Garden Grove singing Nazi march song while giving ‚ÄòHeil Hitler‚Äô salute ‚Äì Orange County Register," Local News Video from 2018 shows water polo athletes at Pacifica High in Garden Grove singing Nazi march song while giving ‚ÄòHeil Hitler‚Äô salute By Susan Christian Goulding | sgoulding@scng.com | Orange County Register PUBLISHED: August 19, 2019 at 12:48 pm | UPDATED: August 20, 2019 at 9:31 am Garden Grove Unified School District officials are facing questions about the handling of an anti-Semitic incident at Pacifica High last year.
In a video posted on social media , about a dozen members of the 2018 boys‚Äô water polo team are shown performing a Nazi marching song while extending their arms in a Hitler salute. The video shows one boy getting out of his seat and walking away, while at least one other boy remains seated.
The district issued a statement Monday, Aug. 19, saying the video was recorded in November of 2018 prior to an ‚Äúoff-campus student athletics banquet in an empty and unsupervised room at the facility.‚Äù
In the brief clip, one student stands at a podium before an audience of other boys ‚Äì all wearing coats and ties. The identities of the players and their respective team levels are unclear. Some may have been seniors who are no longer at the school.
According to the statement, Pacifica High administrators did not become aware of the video until March of 2019, four months later.
‚ÄúThe video was shared within a small group of students on SnapChat,‚Äù the district said.
Officials said administrators ‚Äútook immediate action and addressed the situation with all students and families involved.‚Äù
Federal law prohibits disclosing details of student discipline, the district said.
‚ÄúIn response to this unfortunate incident,‚Äù the statement said, ‚Äúdistrict and school administrators have reached out to community organizations to provide support that will continue to ensure an anti-bias learning environment and address issues of hate.‚Äù
The district did not say whether the students involved were allowed to remain on their team, which has become a powerhouse in Orange County.
In 2017, the Orange County Register named Pacifica water polo coach Eduardo Osorio ‚Äúcoach of the year,‚Äù saying he had ‚Äúorchestrated the best turnaround in the county by guiding the Mariners to their first CIF-SS and Empire League championships.‚Äù
The team is scheduled to open its season next week.
Rabbi Peter Levi, director of the Anti-Defamation League‚Äôs Orange County chapter, said Pacifica should have proactively addressed the video with the entire campus community.
‚ÄúIn terms of consequences for the students, that is for the school and the parents to figure out,‚Äù Levi said. ‚ÄúBut it could have been an opportunity to express school values and boundaries.‚Äù
The episode echoes an incident earlier this year involving Newport Harbor High students. In March, a photo shared on social media captured students flashing a Nazi salute as they surrounded a swastika formed by red plastic cups.
But reciting a song meant to galvanize German soldiers during World War II required prior online research, said Peter Simi, associate professor of sociology at Chapman University.
‚ÄúThis was not spontaneous,‚Äù said Simi, who studies extremist groups. ‚ÄúYou can argue that a Nazi salute is a spur of the moment thing. You cannot say that about a song. They even had music playing.‚Äù
Levi said the school must investigate ‚Äúhow an obscure Nazi song ended up at that banquet.‚Äù
Related links Students seen in photo on social media flashing Nazi salute around swastika formed with cups Swastika photo sparks outrage ‚Äî including from a Holocaust survivor ‚Äî at meeting in Newport Beach Anne Frank‚Äôs stepsister meets with Newport Beach students in controversial swastika photo 22-year-old charged with posting Nazi propaganda posters at Newport Harbor High School ‚ÄúAlt-right white supremacist groups have stepped up their outreach in the past two years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIs a student flirting with these horrible ideas? If someone is being radicalized online, it needs to be disrupted. All students should feel safe and accepted on campus.‚Äù
The image of Newport Harbor High students, along with friends from other schools, partying around a swastika provoked widespread condemnation. However, the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust instead used it as a chance to educate.
‚ÄúIt was a grim reminder of how urgent our work is,‚Äù said Michele Gold, board chairwoman for the museum. ‚ÄúThe Holocaust did not start with the gas chambers, but with words and symbols.
‚ÄúWe invited the Newport Beach students to take a tour with us, meet a Holocaust survivor and come face to face with artifacts from the Holocaust,‚Äù Gold said. ‚ÄúThe students seemed totally inspired. I think they learned a little more empathy and respect that day.
‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Gold added, ‚Äúwe will reach out to the Garden Grove students.‚Äù

Facebook's latest step in its fight against fake news is to ditch technology in favor of humans.
On Friday, Facebook unveiled a new section of its mobile app called ""News Tab,"" dedicated to delivering news content from various publications, The New York Times reports .

52,alt-right,WeWork's alarming non-compete letters to redundant workers - Business Insider,"WeWork has sent combative legal letters to people it laid off in a round of job cuts earlier in 2019, warning them not to compete with its business. The letters warn the former employees to stick to the terms of their contracts, or the company will pursue legal action. There didn&apos;t seem to be any evidence, however, that the workers had breached their contracts. It is normal to remind employees not to pass on confidential information once they&apos;ve left a company, but UK employment lawyers described WeWork&apos;s letters as ""heavy-handed"" and ""aggressive."" WeWork declined to comment. For more stories about WeWork, click here .
WeWork has been sending ""aggressive"" legal letters to employees affected by global layoffs earlier this year, sources told Business Insider.
The letters warn the former employees to stick to the terms of their contracts, or the company will pursue legal action.
The former workers, who were full-time employees affected by a round of global job cuts earlier in 2019, were told that if they broke their terms, WeWork would ""take action against you personally to recover any loss of profits that the company has suffered or is likely to suffer.""
Business Insider has seen a copy of one of the letters but is not sharing it to preserve the source&apos;s privacy.
While it is normal to remind former employees about the terms of their contract after they leave a job, it is unusual to threaten them with legal action, especially if there is no proof of wrongdoing, legal experts say.
Employees often forget that they are bound by many of the terms of their employment contract for up to 12 months, the experts said.
Such letters often warn that former staff cannot reach out to clients they interacted with. Also, before they leave, they cannot take with them any proprietary information like documents, code, or confidential information about the company. But former WeWorkers who received the letters said they felt stressed by the reminders.
&apos;It felt heavy-handed&apos; Susan Thompson, a UK employment lawyer at Simkins, told Business Insider she had rarely seen this kind of communication in her 20-plus-year career.
""It feels heavy-handed,"" Thompson said. ""Ironically, I don&apos;t think this makes them look stronger but weaker. The company is obviously feeling under pressure.""
While Thompson added that no business should ignore when employees break their contracts, but threatening a worker who was not even necessarily suspected of wrongdoing was unusual.
WeWork&apos;s letter said, ""If the company shall become aware that you have committed any fundamental breaches of your contract and/or there is clear evidence,"" but it does not list any proof of wrongdoing.
""They clearly have no evidence,"" Thompson said. ""A mere suspicion isn&apos;t enough to take anyone to court.""
Michelle Last, an employment lawyer with Keystone Law, also characterized the communication as ""heavy-handed.""
""In the absence of any breach of contract this seems unnecessary and overly aggressive,"" she said. ""Couldn&apos;t they achieve the same end, but without contacting someone in such a manner?""
Last said she would advise the former employees to ignore the letters.
She added: ""If they continue to feel threatened by the company, they could respond and say: &apos;I reserve my right to bring this matter as an attention to the court to consider if your conduct is correct in such a situation.&apos;""
But, she said: ""It&apos;s probably best to ignore it.""
WeWork is looking to drastically cut costs after several months of drama, during which its cofounder Adam Neumann stepped down as CEO and its major investor SoftBank stumped up $1.5 billion as part of a rescue deal.
The firm is due to enter a massive redundancy program to cut 4,000 workers, though it isn&apos;t clear when those layoffs will happen.
WeWork has already outsourced its cleaning staff , laid off dozens of employees from its coding school Flatiron , and reportedly cut staff at its subsidiary Meetup.
WeWork declined to comment.

53,alt-right,"Stephen Miller promoted white supremacist, anti-immigrant articles in private emails to Breitbart - Vox.com","Hundreds of private emails White House senior adviser Stephen Miller sent to a former Breitbart editor show that he recommended white nationalist websites and literature and upheld the 1920s Coolidge administration as a model for setting highly restrictive immigration policies, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The SPLC‚Äôs report draws on more than 900 emails, about 80 percent of which touched on the issues of either immigration or race, that Miller exchanged with former Breitbart editor Katie McHugh from March 4, 2015, to June 27, 2016, while he was still an aide for then-US Sen. Jeff Sessions. They illuminate the philosophy guiding Miller, who is largely regarded as the architect of the Trump administration‚Äôs hardline immigration policy.
In an October 23, 2015, email, Miller forwarded McHugh a story from the website VDare, published by Peter Brimelow, who has long been allied with prominent figures in the white nationalist far-right movement. As Jane Coaston explained for Vox , ‚ÄúVDare‚Äôs perception of itself as focused on ‚Äòjust asking questions‚Äô and merely ‚Äò politically incorrect‚Äô is belied by the website itself and its stable of contributors, who include some of the most visible white nationalists in the movement today.‚Äù
Miller cites the VDare story, which summarizes instances in which the US offered citizens of certain countries temporary protections, as a warning of what could happen if Mexicans displaced by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 were to flee to the US southern border.
In a September 6, 2015, email, Miller recommended a racist 1973 dystopian novel, The Camp of The Saints , which has been upheld by nativists and the alt-right as a cautionary tale about the effects of immigration. The book portrays brown-skinned immigrants from India as savages who eat their own feces and invade the ‚Äúwhite world‚Äù of Europe.
‚Äú[Y]ou see the Pope saying west must, in effect, get rid of borders,‚Äù Miller wrote to McHugh. ‚ÄúSomeone should point out the parallels to Camp of the Saints.‚Äù
Breitbart later ran a story doing just that.
Steve Bannon, Trump‚Äôs former chief strategist, has cited the book repeatedly , and Radix, a website founded by leading white nationalist Richard Spencer, has praised it as an exaggerated ‚Äúdistillation and condensation of observable reality.‚Äù
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said that she had not read the SPLC‚Äôs report, but condemned the organization as an ‚Äúutterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization that has recently been forced ‚Äì to its great humiliation ‚Äì to issue a major retraction for other wholly-fabricated accusations.‚Äù In 2016, the group was forced to pay a multimillion-dollar settlement to the Muslim activist Maajid Nawaz for erroneously including him on a list of ‚Äúanti-Muslim extremists‚Äù and issued a public apology .
‚ÄúThey libel, slander, and defame conservatives for a living. They are beneath public discussion,‚Äù Grisham added.
A White House official also accused the SPLC of anti-Semitism for attacking Miller, who is Jewish.
In other emails detailed in the report, Miller repeatedly touted the immigration policies of former President Calvin Coolidge, who signed one of the most restrictive immigration laws in US history, the Immigration Act of 1924. The law severely limited immigration of nonwhites from outside Northern Europe by imposing quotas that tied the number of immigrants admitted from any country to past census counts of how many immigrants of their nationality were already living in the US.
‚ÄúAmerica must be kept American,‚Äù Coolidge wrote at the time. ‚ÄúFor this purpose, it is necessary to continue a policy of restricted immigration.‚Äù
In a June 2, 2015, email, Miller suggested that the beginning of ‚ÄúImmigrant Heritage Month‚Äù could pose a ‚Äúgood opportunity to remind people about the heritage established by Calvin Coolidge, which covers four decades of the 20th century.‚Äù
Miller‚Äôs emails are consistent with the sweeping policy changes he has pursued with the aim of keeping out all but the wealthiest immigrants.
He was behind the so-called public charge regulation, which would have given immigration officials much more leeway to turn away low-income immigrants based on an evaluation of 20 factors, ranging from the use of certain public benefits programs ‚Äî including food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers, and Medicaid ‚Äî to English language proficiency. That regulation, which has been blocked by federal courts for now, could have affected over 382,000 people seeking to enter the US, extend their visa, or upgrade their temporary visa to a green card.
He has also tried to systematically stymie asylum seekers arriving at the US southern border from Central America, where rampant violence and corruption is forcing thousands to flee.
‚ÄúMy mantra has persistently been presenting aliens with multiple unsolvable dilemmas to impact their calculus for choosing to make the arduous journey to begin with,‚Äù he told US Customs and Border Protection officials in a memo first reported on by NBC .

54,alt-right,David Dempsey charged in bear spray attack on Santa Monica anti-Trump protesters - The Washington Post,"Follow October 21, 2019 at 6:11 AM EDT As anti-Trump protesters crowded between the marker for Route 66‚Ä≤s westernmost point and the bright blue police station on Santa Monica Pier on Saturday afternoon, the latest violent political attack unfolded steps from the California beach. About a dozen right-wing demonstrators carrying American flags and wearing shirts supporting President Trump‚Äôs reelection bid shoved their way into the leftist protest. The anti-Trump crowd, arms linked, stood their ground and pushed back. Then, a man wearing a backward ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù cap over his blond man-bun pulled a canister of bear repellent out of his jeans and sprayed the Southern California crowd with a mist of peppery aerosol. Police announced Sunday that they arrested David Nicholas Dempsey, 32, on felony charges for allegedly violating his parole, using a prohibited tear gas weapon and assaulting the crowd with a caustic chemical, KTLA reported . AD AD ‚ÄúIt was these f---ing libtards over here, man,‚Äù the California man, in a short-sleeve button-down shirt with a marijuana-leaf print, told police in video captured at the protest . ‚ÄúThese commies ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù Saturday‚Äôs march was planned by an anti-Trump group called Refuse Fascism , which has partnered with the Revolutionary Communist Party and other leftist organizations to plan nonviolent protests since the 2016 election. Refuse Fascism advocates for the removal of the Trump administration, including Vice President Pence and the president‚Äôs Cabinet, and launched a pro-impeachment campaign called ‚ÄúOut Now‚Äù on Saturday. The group said dozens of activists gathered on the beach in the early afternoon holding multicolored fabric to spell out ‚ÄúTrump-Pence #OutNow!‚Äù Then, the group marched along the boardwalk and onto the Santa Monica Pier to hold a rally. AD AD A small group of Trump supporters followed the leftist protesters to the pier. The groups exchanged insults for about 10 minutes, police told the Los Angeles Times , before shoving one another and screaming obscenities. ‚ÄúEverything went to crap,‚Äù Santa Monica Police Sgt. D. Hicks, who did not give his full name, told the newspaper . That‚Äôs when Dempsey pulled out the bear spray, video shows. ‚ÄúAt least 10 other people got directly pepper sprayed in the face,‚Äù a writer for the Revolutionary Communist Party wrote in a post recounting the incident. Two other pro-Trump supporters grabbed one man from the crowd and held him on the ground, against the sandy wooden planks of the pier. Video shows Dempsey running up to the man and spraying bear repellent into his face as the other men hold him down. Then, Dempsey and another Trump supporter quickly walk away. AD AD Police cornered Dempsey shortly after the incident, detaining him in an alcove in front of the police substation on the pier, just steps from where the attack unfolded. Dempsey and another protester, who told police he was Dempsey‚Äôs brother, said they had been attacked by the Refuse Fascism crowd. Protesters denied that story to police, offering to show them video of Dempsey spraying people after running up to the group from a few feet away. ‚ÄúWhy am I being penned up when you‚Äôve got all these people who attacked us?‚Äù Dempsey said to a police officer who questioned him while onlookers recorded the conversation. When an officer moved to place Dempsey in handcuffs, he complained, ‚ÄúWhy do you have to put me in handcuffs?‚Äù and again blamed the attack on ‚Äúcommies.‚Äù AD In its post recounting the incident, the Revolutionary Communist Party said that several people were hurt as people scrambled out of the way of the fiery spray and that one protester may have broken her arm in the chaos. Police said no protesters suffered severe injuries , although some were treated for exposure to the bear spray. AD A Facebook account that appears to belong to Dempsey regularly insults liberals and celebrates Trump. Some posts spread conspiracy theories about mass shootings, and two posts from August criticized Trump for statements he made supporting ‚Äúred flag‚Äù laws after 22 people were shot and killed at an El Paso Walmart. California has seen several violent street attacks and alleged terrorist plots motivated by politics since the 2016 election, as far-right groups have targeted West Coast cities seen as liberal strongholds and left-wing activists have taken to the streets to protest the Trump administration. AD Antifascists in black tussled with far-right groups in Berkeley, Calif. , in 2017, and vocal opposition led right-wing groups to cancel protests in the San Francisco Bay area. Several hate groups have become increasingly active in the state, targeting leftist activists and holding public demonstrations. In April, the FBI arrested a San Fernando Valley man who planned to bomb a right-wing protest in Long Beach, Calif., as revenge for a massacre in March at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand . AD The bear spray attack on Saturday showed the continued danger of extremist political violence, advocates say. ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äôs desperate violence by remnants of Trump‚Äôs tattered alt-right coalition is another example of why city leaders and law enforcement need to continue take these attacks on community safety seriously,‚Äù Eric Ward, executive director of the Western States Center, a nonprofit that works to counter far-right extremism, said in a statement to The Washington Post. ‚ÄúThese individuals must be held responsible for intentionally sowing chaos and violence in communities.‚Äù AD Dempsey has a ‚Äúfairly extensive‚Äù criminal record, police told the L. A. Times . KTLA reported that the Southern California man had been previously convicted of burglary twice, as well as larceny and conspiracy. Police said he was on parole on Saturday and would have been prohibited from possessing bear repellent or similar tear gas weapons because of his status as a felon. Police told the Associated Press that a second man may have also attacked the anti-Trump crowd with pepper spray on Saturday. Investigators said they are still analyzing video of the clash to identify the other suspect. Los Angeles County Sheriff‚Äôs Office records show that Dempsey is being held in jail without bond. His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday.

55,alt-right,Trump responds to California wildfires by threatening to cut federal aid - Vox,"As California continues to suffer from a number of wildfires , President Donald Trump has made a vague threat to cut federal aid to the state‚Äôs fire recovery efforts.
Amid high winds and dry weather, the fires have spread so rapidly that California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency last week to mobilize resources to fight the blazes. Californians have been experiencing historic blackouts and mandatory evacuations. Hundreds of people have lost their homes, and more than 10,000 acres have burned.
Rather than address those hit with tragedy, Trump criticized Gov. Newsom Sunday morning for doing a ‚Äúterrible job of forest management.‚Äù In a following tweet, Trump implied that he would cut federal aid because of his dissatisfaction with how Newsom has dealt with the fires.
..Every year, as the fire‚Äôs rage & California burns, it is the same thing-and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don‚Äôt see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2019 Newsom quickly responded to Trump on Twitter, rebuking the president for his past as a climate science denier.
Trump has a long history of refusing to acknowledge that human activity is expediting global warming; when the National Climate Assessment, a major government report on climate change, warned of the devastating impacts of climate change, Trump simply said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it.‚Äù
You don‚Äôt believe in climate change. You are excused from this conversation. https://t.co/PSt8N39Er5
‚Äî Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 3, 2019 The tweets marked a complete turn of events: Just a few days before, Newsom had shown rare gratitude toward the administration for its help with the wildfires, according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
‚ÄúHis team is performing above and beyond expectation,‚Äô‚Äô Newsom said. ‚ÄúEvery single request we‚Äôve had to the administration has been met.‚Äô‚Äô
Experts have noted Trump‚Äôs tweets also provided misleading advice for fire management. Despite his encouragement to ‚Äúclean‚Äù the forest floors, raking isn‚Äôt helpful for California, a state that is experiencing intense fires because of climate change related reasons, according to The Washington Post . Vox‚Äôs Eliza Barclay has explained that as temperature continues to rise, the land grows more arid, thus making trees and shrubs more flammable ‚Äî raking would do nothing to change that.
Also of issue is the fact that most of the fires this season aren‚Äôt happening in forests. The Getty fire and others near Los Angeles broke out on ‚Äúvegetation-dominated hillsides,‚Äù The Washington Post reported. And even if they had broken out in forests, it would be difficult to lay the responsibility for forest management at the state‚Äôs feet. The University of California found that 57 percent of about 33 million acres of forest in the state is managed by federal agencies, ABC News reported .
Trump and Newsom are at odds on everything ‚Äî including wildfire management This isn‚Äôt the first time Trump has made such a threat. When California was fighting deadly fires last November, he tweeted out similar criticisms of the state‚Äôs forest management. ‚ÄúRemedy now, or no more Fed payments!‚Äù he said, although no concrete action was taken afterward. Then, again in January, the president tweeted out a similar threat that led to no action as well.
There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019 These threats are partially fueled by Trump‚Äôs poor relationship with Newsom, who has been open about his disapproval with the administration. Newsom took the opportunity in September to criticize Trump for his poor environmental policies during the opening ceremony of New York‚Äôs Climate Week, where he spoke about California‚Äôs climate plans.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell happened to this country that we have a president that we do today on this issue,‚Äù Newsom said, according to the Los Angeles Times . ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a damn shame. It really is. I‚Äôm not a little embarrassed about it ‚Äî I‚Äôm absolutely humiliated by what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù
Their clashes haven‚Äôt stopped at verbal arguments. So far the state has filed more than 60 lawsuits against the administration on a range of topics from immigration to climate change. Their most recent legal dispute: Trump‚Äôs decision to revoke a waiver that allowed California to hold higher emissions standards for cars than the federal government. While Trump characterized the policy as a business opportunity for the auto industry in California, Newsom decried it as a threat to public health.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a move that could have devastating consequences for our kids‚Äô health and the air we breathe if California were to roll over,‚Äù Newsom said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards.‚Äù
Because of this bitter history, Trump has never shied away from blaming Newsom for California‚Äôs problems ‚Äî even if it mean capitalizing on the tragedy of wildfires.

56,alt-right,Steve Bannon Says Nancy Pelosi Is 'Winning' And 'Will Impeach' Donald Trump,"Ex-Defense Secretary: Trump's Actions 'an Attempt to Extort' Ukraine
Democrats launched the fast-moving impeachment inquiry against Trump at the end of September after an anonymous government whistleblower raised concerns that the president was abusing his office to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations in an effort to damage his political rivals. It was also alleged that the president temporarily withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as part of the pressure campaign. Bill Taylor , the current top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland , the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, have both confirmed to investigators that the aid was withheld to pressure the leaders of the Eastern European nation to open the probes.
The military aid to Ukraine was approved by Congress with bipartisan support, and several prominent Republicans have raised serious concerns about the president's actions. However, Trump and his supporters have argued that the impeachment inquiry is purely ""partisan."" Bannon told Catsimatidis that Trump's goal right now should be to pressure all Republicans to vote against impeachment, so the entire investigation will be viewed as merely political.
Numerous polls have shown that the majority of Americans support the impeachment inquiry against Trump. However, the support is divided along party lines, with the vast majority of Democrats approving of the congressional probe, while the majority of Republicans disapprove.
Bannon departed from the Trump administration in August of 2017 following the violent Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville. The event brought together neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right, many of whom felt emboldened by Trump's victory. A counter demonstrator was killed during the protests, but Trump insisted there were ""very fine people"" on both sides. Bannon had reportedly encouraged the president to spread blame for the violence, instead of specifically condemning the white nationalists.
Despite Bannon's departure from the White House, he has continued to be a supporter of the president. Trump has also reportedly stayed in contact with the alt-right figure.

57,alt-right,Antifa Viciously Beat Female Real Estate Employee in Her Own Home," Election 2019 ‚Ä¶Latest Polls Brexit Betrayal Boris Johnson Nigel Farage Migrant Crisis Sweden Italy Antifa Viciously Beat Female Real Estate Employee in Her Home 4,241 ZAKARIA ABDELKAFI/AFP/Getty Images Chris Tomlinson 5 Nov 2019 German far-left Antifa extremists broke into the apartment of a real estate company employee and viciously beat her in an ongoing war against a luxury apartment development in Leipzig. The attack saw two far-left extremists invade the apartment of the 34-year-old real estate worker at around 7 p.m. on Sunday and hit her in the face with their fists several times, according to police spokesman Andreas Loepki, German tabloid Bild reports .
After the attack, Loepki said that the Antifa extremists told the woman: ‚ÄúGoodbye, ‚ÄòGreetings from Connewitz.'‚Äù
The Connewitz area of Leipzig has long been associated with Antifa , as the group even boasts its own Facebook page .
The Antifa group has been at war over the development of several construction sites across Leipzig this year, setting two cranes on fire on October 3rd at a site run by the same company the 34-year-old female victim works for and causing an estimated ten million euros in damages.

According to police spokesman Loepki, the home invasion and assault is an entirely new tactic from the far-left extremists.
‚ÄúThere were already comparable home visits from the left spectrum. But they have always been against right-wing extremists,‚Äù he said.
Leipzig Lord Mayor Burkhard Jung, a member of the left-wing Social Democrats (SPD), also condemned the violence saying: ‚ÄúA line has been crossed: the militant left scene does not even shy away from attacks on defenceless women.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe line spread by the extreme left-wing scene, that they are violent only against things and state institutions, but not against people, is exposed for what it always was: a lie,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúThe rule of law must be applied consistently. We have to be careful that in the current debate about right-wing terrorism, we do not lose sight of left-wing extremism and its contempt for humanity, which is not inferior to that of the right-wing,‚Äù he said, warning that political murders by the left could be on the horizon.
The extremists involved in the attack took credit on the far-left publishing platform Indymedia, saying they ‚Äúdecided to meet those responsible for building a problematic project in the south of Leipzig where it really hurts: in their face‚Äù.
Indymedia has been used time and time again by Antifa extremists in Germany to take credit for acts of violence and sabotage including the attempted assassination of populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) MP Frank Magnitz earlier this year in Bremen.

Following the over 2,000 crimes , including the assault of hundreds of police officers , by black bloc Antifa extremists at the Hamburg G20 in 2017, the German government shut down the notorious ‚ÄúLinksunten‚Äù site hosted on Indymedia.
The site was well-known as a place not only for extremists to brag about attacks, but also to give each other advice on how to sabotage infrastructure and build weapons, including explosives .

58,alt-right,"Sandy Hook shooting: Parent awarded $450,000 for defamation","Twitter bans Alex Jones and Infowars
In his book, written with co-author Mike Palacek, Mr Fetzer claimed that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, manufactured by the Obama administration as part of an effort to tighten gun laws.
The book, and a later blog post by Mr Fetzer, included several false statements about Noah's death certificate, including claims that Mr Pozner had circulated fabricated copies. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The sister of a Sandy Hook victim tells the BBC she is getting threats from conspiracy theorists
Mr Pozner reached a settlement with Mr Palacek last month. The terms have not been disclosed.
On Tuesday, Mr Pozner emphasised that the case was not about First Amendment protections for free speech.
""Mr Fetzer has the right to believe that Sandy Hook never happened. He has the right to express his ignorance,"" he said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.
""This award, however, further illustrates the difference between the right of people like Mr Fetzer to be wrong and the right of victims like myself and my child to be free from defamation, free from harassment and free from the intentional infliction of terror.""
Mr Pozner's lawyer Genevieve Zimmerman described Mr Fetzer's claims in both the 2015 book and 2018 blog post as ""alt-right opium"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alex Jones faces multiple defamation suits related to his claims about Sandy Hook
It is one of several defamation cases launched in the wake of Sandy Hook, many led by Mr Pozner.
He and Noah's mother, Veronique De La Rosa, have also sued prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation. The pending case is one of at least five faced by Mr Jones.
Last week, a Texas court ruled that Mr Jones could not invoke free-speech law to end a separate suit, waged by Scarlett Lewis, the mother of Sandy Hook victim Jesse Lewis.
Parents of Sandy Hook victims who have spoken publicly about their experiences have been targeted by trolls, both online, as well as in person.

59,alt-right,Facebook News launches with Breitbart as a source - CNN,"(CNN Business) When Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was developing a section for news , he said it would be devoted to curating ""high quality"" information from ""trustworthy"" sources. That was back in April.
On Friday, as Facebook began rolling out the product for testing to users in the United States, the company revealed a baffling decision: Among reputable partners like CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post, it had decided to include Breitbart in its list of sources for Facebook News. (A Facebook spokesperson said Breitbart will not be paid, and that it's the site's current content on the platform that made the outlet eligible.) For those in need of a reminder, Breitbart is a far-right website with a history of publishing misleading stories about Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump. The site also has close ties to the Trump administration , and many of its employees have gone on to work in the White House. Former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon once described the site as a ""f***ing machine"" that he could use to ""crush the opposition."" Bannon had previously called the website a ""platform for the alt-right."" That doesn't sound like a ""trustworthy"" source one would rely on for ""high quality"" news. But, according to Facebook, it is. Experts assail: If Breitbart is ""high quality"" news, what's low? Read More CNN Business reached out to some experts in the journalism field to ask them what they thought of Facebook's decision. None were supportive. Columbia Journalism School Ph.D. chair Todd Gitlin, also a longtime progressive, asked, ""If Breitbart.com, which under Steve Bannon's tutelage devoted itself to fraudulent inflammatory immigrant-hating claims, is 'high quality,' what's low? Including Breitbart on [Zuckerberg's] 'news tab' disgraces the name of news."" WaPo media critic Erik Wemple commented: ""Breitbart, a 'trusted' news outlet? Trusted, indeed -- to attack the female accusers of Breitbart buddy Roy Moore. That episode alone should be enough to actuate Facebook to reconsider this call."" And conservative commentator and Bulwark Editor-In-Chief Charlie Sykes told me, ""Facebook's choice is worse than embarrassing; it's inexplicable. Breitbart is a poster child for disinformation and hackery."" Back in 2017, BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein published a blockbuster story that relied on a cache of documents he obtained and documented on how Breitbart ""smuggled white nationalism into the mainstream."" On Friday, Bernstein tweeted, ""One way to think about Facebook naming Breitbart a 'trusted news source': my investigation two years ago contained revelations so damning Breitbart funder Robert Mercer stepped down as CEO of his hedge fund. But it's good enough for Zuck & co."" The New York Times' Charlie Warzel wrote in a tweet that Breitbart ""being in Facebook's trusted partners is clarifying."" Why? Well, he pointed out ""it's the same principle as dinner"" with people like Fox host Tucker Carlson. Which is to say, ""FB's perspective seems to be that if you achieve a certain [amount] of scale and influence, the company will engage earnestly with you."" Warzel said ""it's an outdated idea of media power."" At Friday's Paley Center event, the New York Times' Marc Tracy asked Zuckerberg about the decision to include Breitbart. Zuckerberg said he believes ""you want to have content that represents different perspectives."" Zuckerberg noted that all of the outlets will have to comply with a common set of standards . He added that being eligible for the News tab's algorithmic selections is ""different from what the curators and the journalists who are picking the top stories necessarily choose as the most relevant thing to surface."" Other than Breitbart, it's not clear what other websites or organizations known for misinformation, if any, Facebook might be partnering with. A spokesperson declined to provide the full list of partners to CNN Business. ""We are not sharing a full list of outlets,"" the spokesperson said. So if Facebook is confident in the partners it has chosen, why isn't it making the full list public?",2019-10-26T03:00:00.000+03:00,cnn.com,cnn|*|business|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|announce|*|facebook|*|develop|*|section|*|news|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|devoted|*|curate|*|high_quality|*|information|*|trustworthy|*|source|*|april|*|friday|*|facebook|*|begin|*|roll|*|product|*|testing|*|user|*|united_states|*|company|*|reveal|*|baffling|*|decision|*|reputable|*|partner|*|like|*|cnn|*|new_york|*|times|*|washington_post|*|-pron-|*|decide|*|include|*|breitbart|*|-pron-|*|list|*|source|*|facebook|*|news|*|facebook|*|spokesperson|*|breitbart|*|pay|*|-pron-|*|site|*|current|*|content|*|platform|*|outlet|*|eligible|*|need|*|reminder|*|breitbart|*|far_right|*|website|*|history|*|publish|*|mislead|*|story|*|democrats|*|critic|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|site|*|close|*|tie|*|trump_administration|*|-pron-|*|employee|*|work|*|white_house|*|breitbart|*|chairman|*|steve|*|bannon|*|describe|*|site|*|machine|*|-pron-|*|use|*|crush|*|opposition|*|bannon|*|previously|*|website|*|platform|*|alt_right|*|sound|*|like|*|trustworthy|*|source|*|rely|*|high_quality|*|news|*|accord|*|facebook|*|-pron-|*|expert|*|assail|*|breitbart|*|high_quality|*|news|*|low|*|read|*|cnn|*|business|*|reach|*|expert|*|journalism|*|field|*|ask|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|think|*|facebook|*|decision|*|supportive|*|columbia|*|journalism|*|school|*|chair|*|todd|*|gitlin|*|longtime|*|progressive|*|ask|*|steve|*|bannon|*|tutelage|*|devote|*|-pron-|*|fraudulent|*|inflammatory|*|immigrant|*|hate|*|claim|*|high_quality|*|low|*|include|*|breitbart|*|zuckerberg|*|news|*|tab|*|disgrace|*|news|*|wapo|*|medium|*|critic|*|erik|*|wemple|*|comment|*|breitbart|*|trusted|*|news_outlet|*|trust|*|attack|*|female|*|accuser|*|breitbart|*|buddy|*|roy|*|moore|*|episode|*|actuate|*|facebook|*|reconsider|*|conservative|*|commentator|*|bulwark|*|editor|*|chief|*|charlie|*|sykes|*|tell|*|-pron-|*|facebook|*|choice|*|bad|*|embarrassing|*|-pron-|*|inexplicable|*|breitbart|*|poster|*|child|*|disinformation|*|hackery|*|buzzfeed|*|joe|*|bernstein|*|publish|*|blockbuster|*|story|*|rely|*|cache|*|document|*|-pron-|*|obtain|*|document|*|breitbart|*|smuggle|*|white_nationalism|*|mainstream|*|friday|*|bernstein|*|tweet|*|way|*|think|*|facebook|*|naming|*|breitbart|*|trusted|*|news|*|source|*|-pron-|*|investigation|*|year_ago|*|contain|*|revelation|*|damn|*|breitbart|*|funder|*|robert|*|mercer|*|step|*|ceo|*|-pron-|*|hedge_fund|*|-pron-|*|good|*|zuck|*|new_york|*|times|*|charlie|*|warzel|*|write|*|tweet|*|breitbart|*|facebook|*|trusted|*|partner|*|clarify|*|-pron-|*|point|*|-pron-|*|principle|*|dinner|*|people|*|like|*|fox|*|host|*|tucker|*|carlson|*|fb|*|perspective|*|-pron-|*|achieve|*|certain|*|scale|*|influence|*|company|*|engage|*|earnestly|*|-pron-|*|warzel|*|-pron-|*|outdated|*|idea|*|medium|*|power|*|friday|*|paley|*|center|*|event|*|new_york|*|times|*|marc|*|tracy|*|ask|*|zuckerberg|*|decision|*|include|*|breitbart|*|zuckerberg|*|-pron-|*|believe|*|-pron-|*|want|*|content|*|represent|*|different|*|perspective|*|zuckerberg|*|note|*|outlet|*|comply|*|common|*|set|*|standard|*|-pron-|*|add|*|eligible|*|news|*|tab|*|algorithmic|*|selection|*|different|*|curator|*|journalist|*|pick|*|story|*|necessarily|*|choose|*|relevant|*|thing|*|surface|*|breitbart|*|-pron-|*|clear|*|website|*|organization|*|know|*|misinformation|*|facebook|*|partner|*|spokesperson|*|decline|*|provide|*|list|*|partner|*|cnn|*|business|*|-pron-|*|share|*|list|*|outlet|*|spokesperson|*|facebook|*|confident|*|partner|*|-pron-|*|choose|*|-pron-|*|list|*|public
60,alt-right,"Donald Trump Jr and Kimberly Guilfoyle Booed at Book Launch, Walk Out as Crowd Chants 'America First'","Donald Trump Jr. stormed out of an event promoting his new book yesterday after he was heckled by a protester and supporters angered by his refusal to take questions.
The president's eldest son walked out on Trump backers at the University of California campus in Westwood, Los Angeles yesterday after they shouted ""USA!"" and ""Q&A!"" at the author for not letting the audience participate, The Guardian reported .
Anti-Trump protesters also interrupted Trump Jr.'s book launch organized by Turning Point USA, with one inside the event chanting ""Immigrants are welcome here"" while protesters outside chanted ""Trump, Pence Out Now!""
In a clip broadcast by Fox 2 KTVU , the protester who worked her way inside the launch of ""Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us"" can be heard shouting ""immigrants are welcome here"" to booing from Trump Jr.'s audience.
""My mom is an immigrant,"" the president's son responded. ""But she did it legally.""
Another video from ABC 7 Eyewitness shows Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is also an adviser to President Trump, hitting back at other hecklers in the crowd for drowning out her partner.
Donald Trump Jr. speaks with patrons during a signing event for his new book, ""Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,"" at Barnes & Noble on November 5 in New York City. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty She said: ""You're not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive and discourteous. We're happy to answer a question.
""Respect the people around you so they can hear. You don't play by the same rules.""
The Guardian reported that the packed book launch was barely 20 minutes into a scheduled 2-hour slot before Trump Jr. found himself being shouted down by an audience who were told ""time constraints"" meant they were not permitted to ask questions.
After failing to convince angered attendees to settle down and listen, Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle decided to leave the book launch.
Veteran Scorns Trump Jr. for Comparing Family's Suffering to Dying in War Read more A video shared on Twitter by a fan of Nick Fuentes, the alt-right commentator who attacks the campus conservative group Turning Point USA from the right, shows the couple being booed as they leave the building by a large group chanting ""American First.""
Fuentes later tweeted that the abrupt end to the event was a ""HUGE victory"" for the conservative protesters.
Following the frosty reception he received at the Los Angeles campus, Trump Jr. attended a far tamer lecture and book signing at the Reagan Library in California.
He has further promotional events scheduled today in Scottsdale, Arizona and the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas as America honors military personnel on Veterans Day.
The small number of anti-Trump protesters who appeared outside the ""Triggered"" launch event at UCLA yesterday were organised by activist group Refuse Fascism.

61,alt-right,Stephen Miller May Be Even More Racist Than Previously Known,"Photo: MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images Nobody would mistake Stephen Miller for a humanitarian. The White House speechwriter is widely known to be the force shaping President Trump‚Äôs anti-immigration rhetoric and policies. Remember Trump‚Äôs Oval Office address in January, with its hyperbolic references to rapes, murders, and even dismemberment? That was all Miller, as McKay Coppins reported for The Atlantic at the time. Or the speech the president gave in Poland back in 2017? ‚ÄúThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,‚Äù Trump told a crowd in Warsaw. ‚ÄúDo we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?‚Äù If that sounds too eloquent for Trump, you‚Äôre right. The words belonged to Miller. So, too, did many of Trump‚Äôs most outrageous immigration policies, like family separation , and his ongoing quest to end temporary protected status for thousands of refugees.
None of this suggests that Trump is fully Miller‚Äôs puppet. Trump was a racist long before he became president and he campaigned on nationalist sentiments that Miller appears to share. But it is true that Miller has used the Trump White House to amplify his own, more developed notions about immigrants and race. A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center clarifies the source of Miller‚Äôs views. He isn‚Äôt just an immigration skeptic. He‚Äôs immersed in the white-nationalist movement, and has been at least since he worked for Jeff Sessions.
Reporter Michael Edison Hayden says he received 900 emails between Miller and editors at Breitbart, a far-right website largely favorable to Trump. The emails were leaked by Katie McHugh, who was fired from Breitbart, and who told BuzzFeed News earlier this year that she had joined and then left the alt-right. In them, it‚Äôs clear that Miller directly influenced Breitbart‚Äôs coverage, and frequently shared links from white-nationalist websites, including InfoWars, VDare.com, and American Renaissance, with the expectation that McHugh would pick up their coverage for Breitbart. Miller also recommended Camp of the Saints , a book widely beloved by the alt-right . In it, Europe foolishly opens itself to hordes of refugees, who proceed to rape and murder the native inhabitants. Multiculturalism will kill you, it suggests; it will offer up your women and destroy your children. Steve Bannon loves the book. Even mainstream conservative commentators like Rod Dreher have offered somewhat more qualified ‚Äî but still largely positive ‚Äî assessments of its contents. Miller‚Äôs affection for the book not only shows him to be well-versed in the literature of the alt-right; it also helps establish a genealogy for the Trump administration‚Äôs posture toward refugees.
Miller‚Äôs white-nationalist sympathies aren‚Äôt limited to immigration. After Dylann Roof murdered black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, Miller was troubled by the prospect that Confederate monuments might disappear. In one message to McHugh, he wrote, ‚ÄúWhat do the [Confederate monument] vandals say to the people fighting and dying overseas in uniform right now who are carrying on a seventh or eighth generation of military service in their families, stretching back to our founding?‚Äù (The military might have its own white-nationalist problem , but as a matter of fact, it is not an all-white institution.) In a subsequent email, Miller wondered if the Spanish should thus be asked to stop displaying the country‚Äôs flag since it is, after all, a symbol of colonialism.
On their own, the emails are incontrovertible proof that Miller is not only racist, but is conversant in and influenced by white-nationalist thought. But Hayden also confirmed previous reports that as a student at Duke University, Miller worked closely with Richard Spencer, and had been in contact with Peter Brimelow, who would go on to found VDare. ‚ÄúIt was evident to me Miller was not interested in a multicultural society,‚Äù a former student who‚Äôd known Miller told Hayden.
Though the report is damning, the White House has dismissed it. In a statement to press on Tuesday afternoon, the White House denounced SPLC, and seemed to indicate that Miller would remain on staff:
white house statement on the matter pic.twitter.com/TNU9at4ahe
‚Äî hannah gais (@hannahgais) November 12, 2019 Another White House staff told Axios that SPLC‚Äôs report was ‚Äúanti-Semitism,‚Äù since Miller is Jewish. SPLC‚Äôs report was a fitting start to a day that included the FBI‚Äôs yearly report on hate-crime trends, which are at their highest in 16 years.

62,alt-right,White supremacist Richard Spencer makes racist slurs on tape leaked by rival | World news | The Guardian,"Ex-Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos released expletive-laden audio recording amid deepening in-fighting on the far right. White nationalist Richard Spencer, who came to national prominence in the US through his efforts to lend a respectable face to a racist political movement dubbed the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù, has apparently been caught on tape using racist slurs against African Americans and Jewish people.
The expletive-laden audio recording was released on Sunday by former Breitbart writer, Milo Yiannopoulos, on YouTube amid deepening in-fighting on the far right.
The leaked audio, supposedly recorded in the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and the murder of anti-Nazi protester Heather Heyer, appears to feature an angry Spencer ranting against Charlottesville citizens and promising to return to the city for further protests.
On the recording, the voice continues: ‚ÄúLittle fucking kikes. They get ruled by people like me. Little fucking octaroons. My ancestors fucking enslaved those little pieces of fucking shit.‚Äù
Later, he continued, ‚ÄúThose pieces of shit get ruled by people like me. They look up and see a face like mine looking down at them.‚Äù
Spencer popularized the term ‚Äúalt right‚Äù to describe a politics that combined racist white nationalism, isolationism and criticism of mainstream conservatism. Alt Right support for the 2016 Trump campaign, and Spencer‚Äôs cultivation of a superficial civility ‚Äì largely avoiding crude slurs and the markers of previous neo-Nazi subcultures ‚Äì allowed Spencer to gain media coverage and a hearing in some mainstream outlets. As recently as July 2019 Spencer was interviewed on CNN.
Presented with a partial transcript by the Guardian, Spencer claimed not to recall making any such remarks, and said he would issue a statement and ‚Äúget to the bottom of this‚Äù on Monday.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve listened to it. I‚Äôll be responding today in video form this afternoon. I‚Äôm responding on my own. Not through the press,‚Äù he said via text. He declined to deny that the voice in the video was his.
Spencer also later tweeted a link to a rightwing video titled: Never Apologise.
Asked how he came by the recording, Yiannopoulos said via email that: ‚ÄúIt was recorded by someone whose identity I have verified, and who I have placed where/when they said they recorded it. A second witness remembers the rant and remembers that person being present, and three others who have known Spencer for years confirm the voice is unmistakably his.‚Äù
Asked if the Guardian could be put in touch with his sources to confirm this information, Yiannopoulos said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not inclined to go out of my way for a publication that lies so outrageously and so often about me and so many of my friends.‚Äù
Last year, the Guardian reported that Yiannopoulos was some $2m in debt.
Unlike Spencer, who still has a Twitter account, Yiannopoulos has been deplatformed from many social media services. But on his channel on the messaging service, Telegram, Yiannopoulos repeated his claims about sourcing, and added: ‚ÄúI have always publicly hated Spencer, and he has always publicly hated me.‚Äù
The recording, released on YouTube, is prefaced with an extract from a recent interview in which Spencer criticizes white nationalist YouTuber, Nick Fuentes. Fuentes and Spencer have criticized one another repeatedly this year.

63,alt-right,"Child drag queen poses next to almost-naked adult counterpart, but mother says boy not sexualized ‚Äî RT World News","A photo showing a 10-year-old Canadian drag queen posing next to a half-naked adult performer sparked outrage online. But the boy's mother thinks it's all OK and the child is not overtly sexualized.
The world of drag queens ‚Äì male performers taking on exaggeratedly female personas and taking to the stage ‚Äì may seem like an inappropriate place for minors. After all, sexuality plays a major part in a drag performance, and the common wisdom is that sexualizing young children for entertainment is a taboo.
Yet there are child drag queens. One of them ‚Äì Nemis Quinn M√©lan√ßon-Golden ‚Äì received some unwanted attention online after a photo of him posing in a black dress and fishnet tights next to an adult drag queen was posted online. ‚Äî Celso miori (@CelsoMiori) January 12, 2019
The adult co-star, best known by the stage name Violet Chachki, wears stilettos and a patch of fabric to cover the genitals, and that's it. And, as expected, some people on social media were outraged by the image.
The picture was taken by photographer and writer Jonathan Turton while working on an article for the London-based magazine Huck, which writes about different subcultures. It didn't make it into the final story, but there are other photos.
The cover picture shows M√©lan√ßon-Golden, who goes by the stage name Queen Lactatia, wearing the same outfit and a pink wig with his legs spread wide and sitting on a sofa next to his mother. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the most creative, curious, magical kids."" https://t.co/tfypkO7jAO ‚Äî HUCK (@HUCKmagazine) January 9, 2019
Apparently people outraged by Turton's work complained to Instagram about the photo, which was then taken down. The photographer responded by acknowledging that ""that the particular photo‚Ä¶ was distasteful for many"" but stood by the article he wrote for Huck.
""It was a balanced piece about the subject, which ironically probed the issue of sexualizing children. I'd urge anyone to actually read the article before passing judgement,"" he wrote.
Days later he deleted his accounts on social media, which were apparently flooded with threats and expressions of outrage.
In the article, M√©lan√ßon-Golden's mother Jessica indeed speaks about the apparent sexualization of her son in drag performances. But she denies doing anything inappropriate.
""Drag is an adult arena and that's where people question our judgement. So we have to censor things. He knows there are adult aspects of drag that he's not allowed to apply to his show,"" she said.
We would never try to overtly sexualise our child. But if he wears something that makes him feel beautiful, what right do I have to stop him wearing that dress because it might cause people to think things they shouldn't be thinking? It's a circular problem.
The article mentions conservative speaker Ben Shapiro, who is described as an ""alt-right mouthpiece and fierce critic of child drag queens"" , who criticized the mother of another child drag queen for exploiting him ""for attention."" The ""child drag debate"" is an example of ""the widening gap between Liberals and Conservatives in North America and beyond"" in the age of Donald Trump, Turton believes.
RT spoke to Oren Amitay, a psychologist and lecturer at the Ryerson University, who believes a person doesn't have to be an alt-right mouthpiece to be dubious about child drag queens, child beauty contests and other subcultures that bring children into what is normally considered adult occupations.
""I have taught human sexuality almost 20 years,"" he said. ""My mother opened up Canada's first sex store. So I am not prudish. I am as liberal and open-minded as you get.""
Saying that the drag stage is not about the sexuality of the performers is simply not true, and pretending that a child would be an exception is dishonest, Amitay believes.
""Anyone who knows the history of drag queens knows that there is a sexual component. Is it the only component? No. But it's a large part of it.
People are not going [to watch drag queens] for their personality, they are not going there because they think they are intelligent or charming, although charm may be part of the persona. They are going there for this other part of it.
Amitay stressed that he would not pass a judgement on this particular case, but there is a record of professional performers finding it hard to maintain personality without seeking attention from large audiences. A child drag queen may be put at higher risk of developing such problems, he believes.
""If somebody in his late teens or an adult wants to engage in this ‚Äì fine. But when you are a young child and you are still trying to find who you are, you are still trying to gain the sense of who you are in this world ‚Äì and that is purely about your image and your sexuality, regardless of what they want to claim ‚Äì that will have a lasting impact on most children.""

64,alt-right,"Leaked Stephen Miller Emails to Breitbart Directed Race, Anti-Immigrant News Coverage","Leaked Stephen Miller Emails to Breitbart Directed Race, Anti-Immigrant News Coverage Newsweek 1 hr ago Benjamin Fearnow ¬© Alex Wong/Staff/Getty Images Leaked emails from Stephen Miller reveal an obsession with white nationalism, the Confederacy and the denigration of minority communities. Leaked emails from White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller from 2015-2016 reveal an obsession with white nationalism, the Confederacy and the denigration of black and Hispanic communities.
More than 900 private emails between Miller and Breitbart News were examined by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch section, revealing that 80 percent of the messages pertained to race or immigration. The emails sent between March 2015 and June 2016 straddle Miller's time as an aide to then-Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions and his later role on as a senior adviser for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. Miller's emails tout eugenics and white nationalist conspiracy theories and offer news tips to Breitbart on how to cover immigration and amplify stories about black and Hispanic crime.
Katie McHugh, the former Breitbart editor who leaked the emails to Hatewatch, told the SPLC that ""what Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration."" McHugh, who publicly renounced her alt-right ties and beliefs in an interview with Buzzfeed News , was fired from Breitbart in 2017 for an anti-Muslim tweet.
Miller's conversations with McHugh and the Breitbart editors show him suggesting story ideas as well as directing the right-wing publication on how to report anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim news narratives. The now-senior Trump administration adviser who has been instrumental in crafting the president's immigration policies delves into topics ranging from Central American refugees to Nazi literature.
A September 2015 email from Miller recommended Breitbart write about The Camp of the Saints , which the SPLC described as a ""racist French novel"" popular among neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The book fictionalizes the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory and ""white genocide."" Many of Miller's emails directly correspond with stories published on the right-wing website just hours or even weeks later. Eighteen days after Miller's emails about the French novel, Breitbart editor Julia Hahn published a story about Pope Francis urging America to open its borders to ""impoverished migrants"" and citing the Camp of the Saints in the headline.
That same month, Miller sent Breitbart a link to a tweet from right-wing pundit David Frum which laments ""half of all violent crime in Germany committed by 'foreign youths.'"" Miller and McHugh's exchange goes on to discuss how SAT scores plummeted because of the forced inclusion of ""poor and nonwhite students"" into classrooms.
Breitbart spokesperson Elizabeth Moore responded to the SPLC's report on Miller's emails, dismissing the ""previously reported on"" exchanges as ""not exactly a newsflash.""
""It is no surprise to us that the SPLC opposes news coverage of illegal-immigrant crime and believes such coverage is disproportionate, especially when compared to the rest of the media, which often refuse to cover such crimes,"" Moore told SPLC reporter Michael Edison Hayden.
When speaking to SPLC, McHugh recounted an anecdote about Miller pitching her stories and referencing the white supremacist publication, American Renaissance.
""It was after lunchtime. I was sitting at my desk with my MacBook, and as Miller was speaking, I was looking away ... to better concentrate on what he was saying,"" McHugh relayed to Hatewatch. ""Miller asked me if I had seen the recent 'AmRen' article about crime statistics and race. I responded in the affirmative because I had read it. Many of us [on the far right] had read it. I remember being struck by the way he called it 'AmRen,' the nickname.""
That email exchange was also followed up by a July 2015 article headlined , ""New DOJ Statistics on Race and Violence Crime.""
Miller and McHugh's emails also discuss Islamic terrorism at length, with Miller even urging the Breitbart editors to make a story about Umpqua Community College mass killer Chris Harper-Mercer the ""lede"" of the website's coverage.
""[Harper-Mercer] is described as 'mixed race' and born in England. Any chance of piecing that profile together more, or will it all be covered up?"" Miller asked McHugh.
The Southern Poverty Law Center's report goes on to detail comparisons between Miller and white nationalist leader Richard Spencer. Miller has since denied and ""repudiated"" all views expressed by Spencer in the past.

65,alt-right,Democrats call for Stephen Miller to resign after leak of xenophobic emails,"The Southern Poverty Law Center released a cache of hundreds of emails Tuesday leaked by a former Breitbart writer who corresponded with Miller between 2015 and 2016.Several prominent Democrats have called for White House senior adviser Stephen Miller to resign following the release of emails in which he purportedly linked to white nationalist websites. The Southern Poverty Law Center released a cache of hundreds of emails Tuesday leaked by former Breitbart writer Katie McHugh, who corresponded with Miller between 2015 and 2016. In the correspondence, Miller urged Breitbart's increased coverage of crimes by Hispanic and nonwhite people.
NBC News has not seen the emails or been able to confirm their authenticity.
Miller was appointed senior policy adviser to the Trump campaign in January 2016 and later joined President Donald Trump‚Äôs transition team. He currently advises the president on immigration policy and is credited with spearheading Trump‚Äôs hard-line efforts on border security.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted a petition demanding Miller‚Äôs resignation.
‚ÄúStephen Miller must resign. Now,‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez tweeted . ‚ÄúEach day we allow a white nationalist to be in charge of US immigration policy is a day where thousands of children & families lives are in danger.‚Äù
Other Democratic politicians made similar statements. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said Miller needs to step down . Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro called Miller and Trump ‚Äú a shame to our nation .‚Äù Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., tweeted that Trump should fire Miller immediately.
Trump has been 'so cruel' on immigration: Sen. Durbin Nov. 12, 2019 06:39 Conservative politicians did not echo those calls, but Tiana Lowe, a commentator for The Washington Examiner, a newspaper that leans conservative, called for Trump to fire Miller.

‚ÄúA damning email dump from former Breitbart editor Katie McHugh points to Miller simply being a racist who hates immigrants,‚Äù Lowe wrote in an opinion article .
The emails appear to include a variety of correspondence on immigration, with McHugh and Miller exchanging links to a variety of far-right websites, including two that the SPLC has called hate groups .
Asked for comment on the SPLC‚Äôs report, a White House official said: ‚ÄúThis is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against a Jewish staffer.‚Äù
In the emails, Miller appeared to recommend links to white supremacist websites VDARE and American Renaissance, which have both heavily trafficked in the ‚ÄúGreat Replacement‚Äù conspiracy theory. The ‚ÄúGreat Replacement‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhite Genocide‚Äù theory posits that white people are intentionally being ‚Äúreplaced‚Äù in America by other races.
McHugh told Michael Edison Hayden, a senior investigative reporter at the SPLC, that she was ‚Äústruck‚Äù by the way Miller referred to American Renaissance, a white supremacist think tank, by its nickname, AmRen.
Hayden wrote that the SPLC ‚Äúwas unable to find any examples of Miller writing sympathetically or even in neutral tones about any person who is nonwhite or foreign-born.‚Äù
Miller consistently pushed McHugh to cover stories in a certain way, often highlighting angles on race. After an alt-right mass shooter, Chris Harper-Mercer, killed nine people at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, Miller asked Breitbart to highlight his race and make it the most prominent part of the story.
‚ÄúHe is described as ‚Äòmixed race‚Äô and born in England. Any chance of piecing that profile together more, or will it all be covered up?‚Äù according to one of the emails the law center said Miller sent to McHugh.
McHugh was fired from Breitbart in 2017 for tweets she later admitted were racist. McHugh has since disavowed her career at Breitbart and its far-right politics.
‚ÄúYou have to own up to what you did and then forcefully reject this and explain to people and tell your story and say, ‚ÄòGet out while you can,‚Äô‚Äù she told BuzzFeed News in May .
Miller is frequently credited with some of the Trump administration‚Äôs most extreme immigration policies. Miller and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions were the primary proponents of Trump‚Äôs child separation policy , which separated migrant children from parents seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico.
Hayden told NBC News that McHugh sent him the emails in June, in part because of his previous reporting on extremists and white nationalists.
He said the emails struck a tone that was similar to that used by other extremists.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the sort of intellectual white nationalism that‚Äôs very familiar to people covering this stuff,‚Äù Hayden said.
Hayden said the SPLC is set to publish more emails from Miller in the coming days, specifically ones in which Miller targeted Republican opponents of then-candidate Trump in 2015 and 2016. Hayden said McHugh had only met Miller in person once but still sent her almost 1,000 emails.
‚ÄúAnd we only have the emails that start in 2015,‚Äù Hayden said. ‚ÄúIt shows how the degree to which laundering material was going on between Miller and conservative media.‚Äù

66,alt-right,"The Chicago teachers‚Äô strike contract deal, explained - Vox","Thousands of Chicago public school teachers are back in class.
Teachers returned to school Friday after going on strike for 11 days. They had picketed in the snow and rain until union leaders and city officials struck a deal to raise teacher pay and to put a social worker and nurse in each school. Some of the teachers‚Äô most ambitious proposals, such as requiring the city to expand affordable housing, didn‚Äôt make the cut.
‚ÄúDid we accomplish every single little thing? No. But I can say that we moved the needle on educational justice in the city,‚Äù Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, said in a press conference Thursday.
The district also committed to spending $35 million to shrink oversized classrooms and to prioritize schools that serve the most at-risk students. The deal includes a 16 percent pay raise for teachers over five years, and a remarkable 40 percent raise for teaching assistants, clerks, and other lower-paid workers. The new, five-year contract will also boost investment per pupil and reduce the number of students in each class.
Teachers had wanted more, though. They also wanted more affordable housing in the city for students and teachers. That‚Äôs something no teachers union has demanded in recent contract negotiations.
These kinds of broad demands are part of a growing movement, led by teachers and labor unions, focused more on social justice issues affecting their communities than simply pay. It‚Äôs known as ‚Äúbargaining for the common good.‚Äù
Chicago public schools serve a high percentage of poor students, and the district has long struggled with low graduation rates. Though high school graduation rates have improved in recent years, its schools are still highly segregated. And compared to surrounding school districts and elsewhere in Illinois, Chicago schools have larger class sizes, fewer high school teachers with advanced degrees , and less state investment per pupil.
The success of this bargaining model in Chicago and other cities has been mixed so far. Mayor Lori Lightfoot promised to focus on affordable housing, but not as part of contract negotiations with teachers. The union did, however, get the city to give sanctuary protection to undocumented immigrants on school property. The final deal shows that strikes work. Chicago teachers didn‚Äôt get everything they wanted, but they got got more than ever before, including an extra $30 million in spending on education.
Chicago teachers flexed their muscle Lightfoot made national headlines in May when she became the city‚Äôs first black, female mayor. Within months, she had to start negotiating with the teachers union as their last contract was about to expire.
Lightfoot had promised during her campaign to boost investment in neighborhood schools; She pledged to add hundreds of social workers, special education case managers, and nurses at schools within the next five years, according to the education news site Chalkbeat .
But teachers were frustrated that she wouldn‚Äôt put it in writing ‚Äî in their contract. After they went on strike, it was included: The contract guarantees that social workers and nurses will not be outside contractors, and the school has committed to investing millions of dollars in training for current and new support staff.
But the fight between teachers and the city was about much more than that.
Illinois‚Äôs finances are doing much better than they were in 2012 when the teachers last went on strike . The state‚Äôs budget was in the red back then; it was a full-blown financial crisis by 2016. While the city still owes creditors millions of dollars, more state money is flowing to Chicago public schools, which serve a majority of high-poverty neighborhoods.
Chicago saw a surge in tax revenue last year , and teachers want part of the $181 million surplus to go toward hiring more teachers and nurses, and to more social services. That‚Äôs why they were demanding an investment in affordable housing ‚Äî an unusual request from teachers during bargaining talks.
Housing is a crucial issue in Chicago, where black residents have been hurt by historic segregation, disinvestment in their communities, and a growing affordable-housing crisis. Lightfoot says she wants to address affordable housing in the city, but she doesn‚Äôt want that to be part of a contract with teachers.
‚ÄúAffordable housing is a critical issue that affects residents across Chicago, and everyone‚Äôs voices need to be heard during this process,‚Äù Mayor Lightfoot said in a statement last month. ‚ÄúAs such, the [teachers union] collective bargaining agreement is not the appropriate place for the City to legislate its affordable housing policy.‚Äù
But teachers were confident that they could get what they wanted, and they had reason to think so.
A wave of teachers strikes has proven successful Frustration over stagnant teacher wages , crumbling infrastructure, and deep budget cuts to education fueled a wave of teacher protests in conservative states in 2018. Educators went on strike in Arizona , West Virginia , Kentucky, and Oklahoma , forcing state lawmakers to raise teacher pay and spend more on schools.
But progressive states weren‚Äôt immune to the unrest, even though they tend to pay teachers higher salaries.
When tens of thousands of teachers went on strike in Los Angeles in January, it was a sign that the movement had expanded beyond the red states where it began and could lead more progressive cities and states to reexamine their investment in public education, too. As part of the deal to end the strike, LA teachers were able to negotiate smaller class sizes and the district agreed to hire more nurses, guidance counselors, librarians, and support staff.
That‚Äôs what ‚Äúbargaining for the common good‚Äù looks like. It‚Äôs a strategy that seems to pay off. LA teachers inspired Chicago teachers to fight for similar gains ‚Äî and got most of them.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) By Follow November 9, 2019 at 6:31 PM EST House Republicans on Saturday pressed ahead with their efforts to move the impeachment inquiry away from President Trump, calling on Democrats to add witnesses to the probe including former vice president Joe Biden‚Äôs son and the whistleblower whose initial complaint kicked off the investigation. The GOP demands were met with immediate skepticism from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who warned against ‚Äúsham investigations‚Äù of the Bidens and other issues in a clear signal that many of the witnesses were unlikely to be called. The clash came as Democrats prepare to enter a new phase of the impeachment inquiry with public hearings beginning Wednesday, which will focus on Trump‚Äôs alleged efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and other Democrats in exchange for military aid or a White House visit by the Ukrainian president. Witnesses who have testified out of public view have largely corroborated the whistleblower‚Äôs initial allegations. AD AD Republicans have complained that the Democratic-run inquiry is unfairly partisan, and Trump said Saturday that he will ‚Äúprobably‚Äù release a transcript next week of an April call that he made to congratulate Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his election victory. In the weeks ahead, the GOP‚Äôs focus will be to try to minimize Trump‚Äôs role in the Ukraine pressure campaign and to justify his actions by highlighting that country‚Äôs history of corruption problems, according to Republicans familiar with the party‚Äôs strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. More than 2,500 pages of interview transcripts released over the past week provide a road map for the emerging Republican strategy. The documents show the extent to which GOP lawmakers involved in the hearings have focused on unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, Democratic political targets and other subjects favored by Trump allies ‚Äî much of it ancillary to the probe at hand, according to a Washington Post review of the documents. AD AD One GOP lawmaker repeatedly tried to pressure a witness into saying what he wanted to hear about a Ukrainian company that employed Biden‚Äôs son. Another member quizzed a former ambassador in the impeachment inquiry about her national heritage, seeming to probe for bias. And a third Republican interrogated the same diplomat about whether her staff ‚Äúmonitored‚Äù the social media account of an alt-right conspiracy theorist, whose main claim to fame is smearing a Washington pizzeria as the site of a fictional Democratic pedophile ring. There were also questions about the Clinton Foundation and long-gone officials from the Obama administration; probing of witnesses over the attorneys they hired or the release of opening statements; and inquiries about whether witnesses improperly ‚Äúunmasked‚Äù the identities of Trump officials under investigation. The sprawling list of potential witnesses named by Republicans on Saturday continued the pattern. They included Hunter Biden, whose father is a leading Democratic candidate to challenge Trump in 2020; Hunter Biden‚Äôs business partner Devon Archer; the unnamed whistleblower, who Trump and some of his allies have campaigned to publicly identify; the researcher Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS, which commissioned a dossier linking Russia and Trump; and Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian American who worked with the Democratic National Committee. AD AD Republicans also asked to call two witnesses who have already testified behind closed doors, a request that appears likely to be granted by Democrats: National Security Council official Tim Morrison and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, each of whom corroborated parts of the whistleblower‚Äôs complaint while also providing some cover for Republicans. Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the intelligence panel, argued that witnesses such as Biden and Archer would ‚Äúassist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine‚Äôs pervasive corruption, information that bears directly on President Trump‚Äôs long-standing and deeply-held skepticism of the country.‚Äù Schiff said Democrats would evaluate the requests but added in a statement that the inquiry ‚Äúwill not serve ‚Ä¶ as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit, or to facilitate the President‚Äôs effort to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.‚Äù AD AD In their questioning of witnesses so far, Republican lawmakers have been particularly focused on Hunter Biden, who received $50,000 a month for sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was U.S. vice president. They also sought to have witnesses elaborate on why Trump may have been upset with Ukraine and therefore potentially justified in holding back military funding, including asking questions about Ukrainian politicians who said negative things about Trump during his 2016 campaign, the transcripts show. Some Trump allies have suggested that the negative remarks amounted to Ukraine‚Äôs interfering in the 2016 election ‚Äî a contention that Democrats, intelligence experts and even some Republicans dismiss as an attempt to muddy the waters over Russia‚Äôs systematic interference in the election to help Trump. That line of inquiry ‚Äî including suggestions that Ukrainians were out to get Trump or that the Bidens did something corrupt ‚Äî is expected to be a recurring theme for Republicans in public hearings this month. The contrast between the two sides was evident during the testimony of the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., who told lawmakers Oct. 22 that the White House had threatened to withdraw much-needed military aid unless Kyiv announced investigations for Trump‚Äôs political benefit. The unexpected level of detail in Taylor‚Äôs opening statement made many in the room gasp, officials said, and Democratic lawmakers spent their first hour of questioning that day dissecting the details. AD AD But when it was their turn, Republicans didn‚Äôt ask a single question about Taylor‚Äôs opening remarks during their first allotted hour, according to the newly released transcript of the session. Instead, they focused on the Bidens and a 2017 Politico article about how some Ukrainian officials had criticized Trump as a candidate in 2016. ‚ÄúYou mentioned that the company Burisma was a bit of a shady organization?‚Äù GOP staff attorney Steve Castor said, moving the conversation with Taylor toward the company that hired Hunter Biden. ‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs possible that he was tapped for the board because his dad was the vice president?‚Äù Taylor demurred: ‚ÄúSo, Mr. Castor, I‚Äôm here as a fact witness. I don‚Äôt have any facts on that.‚Äù AD Republicans frequently complained about the handling of the probe and argued that the president was being denied his right to due process, the transcripts show. They also frequently criticized Schiff, accusing the majority of keeping them out of the loop on witness schedules, copies of subpoenas or opening statements. AD ‚ÄúI would just state that if we‚Äôre going to continue this circus, I, at least, would like to know what time the circus begins,‚Äù Nunes said at one point. In multiple interviews, Nunes used his time to question the origins of the FBI‚Äôs Russia investigation and to press allegations of bias in the Justice Department. That included attempts to get witnesses to say that the ‚ÄúSteele dossier,‚Äù a document alleging links between Trump and Russia, had a Ukrainian connection. AD Most witnesses told Nunes they had no idea what he was talking about. ‚ÄúAre you aware of who paid for the dossier?‚Äù Nunes asked Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. When Sondland said no, Nunes pressed again: ‚ÄúWould it surprise you to learn that the Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee paid for the dossier?‚Äù AD ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about it,‚Äù Sondland said, later echoing the same comment when Nunes persisted with his line of questioning. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about that, Congressman, I‚Äôm sorry. ‚Ä¶ Again, I haven‚Äôt been following the Steele dossier.‚Äù Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) asked former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch about the origins of her nickname, Masha, seeming to suggest it was Ukrainian; Yovanovitch informed him it was actually Russian. Republicans also grilled her and her attorney about how her opening statement ended up in The Post. AD Lawmakers sought to cast former NSC official Fiona Hill as a leaker, asking her why so many reporters have her cellphone number. Hill noted that she was previously a heavily quoted expert at the Brookings Institution. ‚ÄúI did not leak any information,‚Äù she testified. ‚ÄúI did not talk to the press.‚Äù AD During the deposition of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) raised questions about why the Purple Heart recipient was the only person to formally complain about a July 25 call in which Trump asked the Ukrainian president to ‚Äúdo us a favor‚Äù by investigating his adversaries. Vindman ‚Äî who said the request was ‚Äúimproper‚Äù and brought it to the attention of a White House lawyer ‚Äî told Stewart he could only speak for himself rather than others who listened to the call. Stewart kept pressing him, eventually getting into an argument with Vindman‚Äôs attorney. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask the same stinking question and I‚Äôm going to ask it the same way. ‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt need to come in here and lecture us on how I will ask my questions,‚Äù Stewart said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to represent my client ‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre not just going to run over my client. I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù lawyer Michael Volkov replied. Joe Biden has been a favorite target for Trump-allied lawmakers. Many have adopted Trump‚Äôs unsubstantiated assertion that Biden pushed for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, because he was investigating Burisma. In one session, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) tried three times to get George Kent, the State Department‚Äôs deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs, to say there was an investigation of Burisma at the time Joe Biden pushed for Shokin‚Äôs exit. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the probe into Burisma was dormant at the time. ‚ÄúBut you did testify that Shokin had an investigation into Burisma ‚Ä¶ correct?‚Äù Zeldin asked. After Kent replied, ‚ÄúI did not say that,‚Äù Zeldin tried again: ‚ÄúWhen did you learn of an investigation by Shokin into Burisma?‚Äù ‚ÄúI just told you, I did not learn of an investigation. I‚Äôve read claims that there may have been an investigation,‚Äù Kent said. Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) asked a host of unusual questions during the initial stage of the inquiry, including about whether Yovanovitch‚Äôs staff monitored the social media accounts of conservative and fringe figures. On his list of names was Jack Posobiec, the ‚ÄúPizzagate‚Äù conspiracy theorist who circulated the bizarre conspiracy about a child sex ring. ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù she responded. Republicans also tried to get witnesses to back their unsubstantiated claims of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. After walking Taylor through news clips about Ukrainians‚Äô weighing in against Trump, Castor asked him: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it fair to say that, if you‚Äôre aligned with the Trump administration, isn‚Äôt it legitimate to have a good-faith belief that Ukrainians were operating against you in the 2016 election?‚Äù Taylor said ‚Äúif the reporting is correct ‚Ä¶ you could certainly have the opinion.‚Äù But a few minutes later he shot down Nunes‚Äô assertion that Ukraine wanted Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win in 2016. ‚ÄúAgain, according to this Politico document ‚Ä¶ there were a couple of Ukrainians who did what you said. When you say ‚ÄòUkrainians,‚Äô that paints a broad brush,‚Äù he said. Such disagreements were common. During Sondland‚Äôs deposition, Zeldin suggested that the witness felt ‚Äúunduly pressured‚Äù to agree with a Democratic question about whether it was ‚Äúinappropriate to ask the Ukrainian government to conduct an investigation into a 2020 political rival.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I felt unduly pressured at this deposition at all,‚Äù Sondland replied.

68,alt-right,EarthLink - News,"Officer: I quit Proud Boys over fears of ‚Äòfar-left‚Äô attacks
By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN | Wed, November 13, 2019 05:31 EST
A Connecticut police officer who belonged to a far-right group accused a civil rights activist who had complained to his department of trying to ‚Äúsilence conservative voices,‚Äù according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press.
In his letter, addressed to East Hampton‚Äôs police chief, Officer Kevin Wilcox said he was a dues-paying Proud Boys member for about eight months. But he said he quit the group because he suspected its members would be attacked by ‚Äúfar-left political organizations‚Äù and labeled as bigots due to their ‚Äúlove‚Äù for President Donald Trump.
The AP obtained a copy of Wilcox‚Äôs July 31 letter in response to a public records request.
The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law called for Wilcox's removal from the police department after inquiring about his social media connections with members of the Proud Boys, a group known for its violent clashes at political rallies.
In September, East Hampton Police Chief Dennis Woessner told the organization that Wilcox's Proud Boys membership didn't violate department policies.
Wilcox, 53, retired from the East Hampton Police Department on Oct. 22, one week after the AP reported that Wilcox had been a Proud Boys member and made online payments to a group leader.
Kristen Clarke, the civil rights group's president and executive director, had urged the department to investigate Wilcox‚Äôs ‚Äúpossible connections with white supremacist groups and individuals.‚Äù Her July 24 letter to the police chief described the Proud Boys as a ‚Äúmale-chauvinist group with ties to white nationalism.‚Äù
The chief asked Wilcox for a written response to Clarke‚Äôs allegations. Wilcox said Clarke‚Äôs claim that he publicly associated with white supremacists was ‚Äúan outright lie and an assault on my character.‚Äù
‚ÄúClarke‚Äôs letter is filled with links to far-left propaganda that expose her motive, which is to silence conservative voices. The law firm that she represents is a cudgel used to bludgeon anyone who doesn‚Äôt follow their far left ideology,‚Äù he wrote.
The links in Clarke‚Äôs letter included articles published by PBS, National Public Radio, the Guardian newspaper and the Hartford Courant.
Wilcox also said it is ‚Äúvery telling‚Äù that Clarke‚Äôs organization is funded by ‚Äúmany uber-progressive (alt-left) foundations like George Soros‚Äôs Foundation to Promote Open Society.‚Äù
Soros is a billionaire philanthropist and Hungarian-born Jew who is frequently demonized by right-wing conspiracy theorists.
Clarke said her group‚Äôs ‚Äúsole goal is ensuring public safety at a time of increasing hate activity, extremism and racial violence.‚Äù
‚ÄúExtremists undermine the integrity of law enforcement and pose a threat to public safety,‚Äù she wrote in a text message Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt stop until we eliminate extremists from the ranks of law enforcement, root and branch.‚Äù
Wilcox said he only was a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù member before he quit the Proud Boys in February, about five months before Clarke‚Äôs group first inquired about his Proud Boys ties.
‚ÄúThey were childish and annoying,‚Äù he wrote.
Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes started the Proud Boys in 2016. McInnes and the Proud Boys have described the group as a politically incorrect men's club for ""Western chauvinists"" and deny affiliations with far-right extremist groups that overtly espouse racist and anti-Semitic views.
In February, McInnes sued the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center for labeling the Proud Boys as a hate group. In response to the lawsuit, the law center said Proud Boys members often spread ""outright bigotry"" over the internet and have posted social media pictures of themselves with prominent Holocaust deniers, white nationalists and ""known neo-Nazis.""
In New York City in October 2018, police arrested several Proud Boys members who brawled with anti-fascist protesters following a speech by McInnes at a Manhattan Republican club. Proud Boys members also have frequently clashed with counterprotesters at rallies in California and Oregon.
Wilcox said he paid dues to a group leader and was told the money would pay for food and a room for ‚Äúmeet-ups.‚Äù The civil rights group claimed those publicly visible, online dues payments helped fund the Proud Boys' ""violent or otherwise illegal"" activities.
But the town‚Äôs police chief said he closed the department's inquiry as being ""unfounded,"" with no evidence to support a policy violation or any proof that Wilcox is a white supremacist.
‚ÄúDifferent individuals or organizations can have their own opinions of certain groups or individuals, which may or may not be correct according to others,‚Äù the chief wrote. ‚ÄúAs an example, there are certain individuals/groups who view President Trump as a racist and others do not. Does that mean any person who contributes to the Republican party is therefore a racist?‚Äù
Wilcox had been an East Hampton police officer since 1999. The town is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) southeast of Hartford and has a population of nearly 13,000 residents, roughly 90% of whom are white.

69,alt-right,Victoria Police 'extremely' disappointed with alt-right memes shared by officer accused of making white power gesture,"Victoria Police denounces 'inappropriate' memes posted to social account by officer accused of making white power gesture Updated November 03, 2019 10:52:38
Victoria Police has expressed ""extreme disappointment"" in one of its officers for the second time in two days, after screenshots of his Facebook page displaying alt-right material were shared on social media. Key points: The OK symbol is believed to have become associated with the far-right in 2017 Victoria Police first said ""any suggestion the [officer] was signalling [anything other than OK] was untrue"" But it has since announced it is looking into the possibility of further action after far-right memes were uncovered on the officer's since-deleted social media page
The officer was pictured with his thumb and index finger making an 'OK' sign ‚Äî a symbol frequently used by members of the far right ‚Äî towards protesters at a climate rally in Melbourne this week.
Victoria Police acknowledged the photograph was legitimate, and initially said the officer had confirmed he made the symbol to ask if protesters were OK.
But screenshots then emerged from a Facebook page appearing to belong to the officer, which displayed a number of memes circulated by the alt-right movement.
In a subsequent statement on Saturday, police confirmed they were aware of both the 'OK' hand gesture incident and previous posts to the police officer's social media page, which has since been deleted. Photo: An image of Wojak or ""feels guy"" was used as the officer's profile picture on Facebook.
""In relation to the hand gesture, we have reviewed body-worn camera footage of the incident and it's inconclusive,"" the statement said.
""The footage does not capture both sides of the interaction and is at times obscured by structures and people.""
Police reiterated that the officer had advised he was ""simply using the 'are you OK?' sign"" to communicate with protesters.
""We have spoken extensively to the officer in question and he has advised the hand gesture was simply the 'are you OK' sign directed at two protesters who looked distressed,"" the statement said. Why is the 'OK' symbol associated with the alt right?
The 'OK' sign has been co-opted by the far-right, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international NGO that aims to ""fight anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry"", taking on a new significance after a 2017 4chan hoax.
The prank saw members of the anonymous social network ""falsely promote the gesture as a hate symbol, claiming the gesture represented the letters 'WP' for 'white power',"" according to the ADL.
It became so successful that it morphed into ""a popular trolling tactic on the part of right-leaning individuals"".
The symbol's surge in popularity in turn led to ""at least some white supremacists [abandoning] the ironic or satiric intent behind the original trolling campaign and used the symbol as a sincere expression of white supremacy"" by 2019. Alt right memes 'under no circumstances reflective of Victoria Police values'
The screenshots that Victoria Police confirmed had originated from the officer's personal Facebook page included an image of Wojak or ""feels guy"" being used as the officer's profile picture ‚Äî that image was allegedly used in 2016 by Donald Trump supporters to mock the mentality of liberals.
They also included an image of a crying Pepe the Frog ‚Äî a character that has been linked to the alt-right since 2016, when it was allegedly used in the US election to promote ideals of white nationalism.
""In regards to his social media page, we are aware of a small number of posts which include inappropriate memes,"" Victoria Police said.
""Under no circumstances are these posts reflective of the values of Victoria Police.""
The officer has been spoken to about the posts, and, the statement continued: ""Although they were made more than 12 months ago, he is aware of our extreme disappointment.
""While officers are entitled to have personal social media accounts, we do not want or expect them to be including content which may offend members of the community.""
Victoria Police said it was in the process of determining whether further action would be required.
It comes after another Victoria Police officer involved in responding to climate protests was photographed wearing a sticker with a slogan reading ""EAD hippy"" ‚Äî with the letters EAD often used to mean ""eat a dick"" ‚Äî on his body camera.
In a statement, Victoria Police confirmed the image was genuine, also saying it was ""extremely disappointed"" by that officer's actions.",2019-11-02T09:44:00.000+02:00,abc.net.au,victoria_police|*|denounce|*|inappropriate|*|meme|*|post|*|social|*|account|*|officer|*|accuse|*|white|*|power|*|gesture|*|update|*|november|*|victoria_police|*|express|*|extreme|*|disappointment|*|-pron-|*|officer|*|second|*|time|*|day|*|screenshot|*|-pron-|*|facebook|*|page|*|display|*|alt_right|*|material|*|share|*|social_medium|*|key|*|point|*|ok|*|symbol|*|believe|*|associate|*|far_right|*|victoria_police|*|suggestion|*|officer|*|signal|*|ok|*|untrue|*|-pron-|*|announce|*|-pron-|*|look|*|possibility|*|action|*|far_right|*|meme|*|uncover|*|officer|*|delete|*|social_medium|*|page|*|officer|*|picture|*|-pron-|*|thumb|*|index|*|finger|*|ok|*|sign|*|symbol|*|frequently|*|use|*|member|*|far_right|*|protester|*|climate|*|rally|*|melbourne|*|week|*|victoria_police|*|acknowledge|*|photograph|*|legitimate|*|initially|*|officer|*|confirm|*|-pron-|*|symbol|*|ask|*|protester|*|ok|*|screenshot|*|emerge|*|facebook|*|page|*|appear|*|belong|*|officer|*|display|*|number|*|meme|*|circulate|*|alt_right|*|movement|*|subsequent|*|statement|*|saturday|*|police|*|confirm|*|-pron-|*|aware|*|ok|*|hand|*|gesture|*|incident|*|previous|*|post|*|police_officer|*|social_medium|*|page|*|delete|*|photo|*|image|*|wojak|*|feel|*|guy|*|use|*|officer|*|profile|*|picture|*|facebook|*|relation|*|hand|*|gesture|*|-pron-|*|review|*|body|*|wear|*|camera|*|footage|*|incident|*|-pron-|*|inconclusive|*|statement|*|footage|*|capture|*|interaction|*|time|*|obscure|*|structure|*|people|*|police|*|reiterate|*|officer|*|advise|*|-pron-|*|simply|*|use|*|-pron-|*|ok|*|sign|*|communicate|*|protester|*|-pron-|*|speak|*|extensively|*|officer|*|question|*|-pron-|*|advise|*|hand|*|gesture|*|simply|*|-pron-|*|ok|*|sign|*|direct|*|protester|*|look|*|distressed|*|statement|*|ok|*|symbol|*|associate|*|alt_right|*|ok|*|sign|*|co|*|opt|*|far_right|*|accord|*|anti|*|defamation|*|league|*|adl|*|international|*|ngo|*|aim|*|fight|*|anti_semitism|*|form|*|bigotry|*|new|*|significance|*|hoax|*|prank|*|member|*|anonymous|*|social|*|network|*|falsely|*|promote|*|gesture|*|hate|*|symbol|*|claim|*|gesture|*|represent|*|letter|*|wp|*|white|*|power|*|accord|*|adl|*|-pron-|*|successful|*|-pron-|*|morph|*|popular|*|trolling|*|tactic|*|right|*|lean|*|individual|*|symbol|*|surge|*|popularity|*|turn|*|lead|*|white_supremacist|*|abandon|*|ironic|*|satiric|*|intent|*|original|*|trolling|*|campaign|*|use|*|symbol|*|sincere|*|expression|*|white|*|supremacy|*|alt_right|*|meme|*|circumstance|*|reflective|*|victoria_police|*|value|*|screenshot|*|victoria_police|*|confirm|*|originate|*|officer|*|personal|*|facebook|*|page|*|include|*|image|*|wojak|*|feel|*|guy|*|use|*|officer|*|profile|*|picture|*|image|*|allegedly|*|use|*|donald_trump|*|supporter|*|mock|*|mentality|*|liberal|*|-pron-|*|include|*|image|*|cry|*|pepe|*|frog|*|character|*|link|*|alt_right|*|-pron-|*|allegedly|*|use|*|election|*|promote|*|ideal|*|white_nationalism|*|regard|*|-pron-|*|social_medium|*|page|*|-pron-|*|aware|*|small|*|number|*|post|*|include|*|inappropriate|*|meme|*|victoria_police|*|circumstance|*|post|*|reflective|*|value|*|victoria_police|*|officer|*|speak|*|post|*|statement|*|continue|*|-pron-|*|month_ago|*|-pron-|*|aware|*|-pron-|*|extreme|*|disappointment|*|officer|*|entitle|*|personal|*|social_medium|*|account|*|-pron-|*|want|*|expect|*|-pron-|*|include|*|content|*|offend|*|member|*|community|*|victoria_police|*|-pron-|*|process|*|determine|*|action|*|require|*|-pron-|*|come|*|victoria_police|*|officer|*|involve|*|respond|*|climate|*|protest|*|photograph|*|wear|*|sticker|*|slogan|*|read|*|ead|*|hippy|*|letter|*|ead|*|use|*|mean|*|eat|*|dick|*|-pron-|*|body|*|camera|*|statement|*|victoria_police|*|confirm|*|image|*|genuine|*|-pron-|*|extremely|*|disappointed|*|officer|*|action
70,alt-right,How to Take a Screenshot on a Windows PC | Digital Trends,"Taking a screenshot may be a minor task, but the everyday task has become an important part of online life. You might need a screenshot for work, or need to submit one to tech support, or maybe you just want to capture a great or interesting moment on your computer.
Regardless of the reason behind it, there are a few ways to take a screenshot in Windows. At first, we‚Äôll walk you through the easiest way ‚Äî and then we‚Äôll show you another useful method at the end.
Further reading How to take a screenshot on a Chromebook How to take a screenshot on a Mac How to take a screenshot on an iPhone
Step 1: Capture the image Bring up whatever it is you want to capture on your screen and press the Print Screen (often shortened to ‚ÄúPrtScn‚Äù) key. It‚Äôs typically located in the upper-right corner of your keyboard and will take a screengrab of everything on all of your displays. Alternatively, press Alt + Print Screen to capture a screenshot of the active window. If you‚Äôre on a laptop, you may need to press Fn + Print Screen or the Windows key + Print Screen if your laptop has another feature assigned to that particular key.
In many computers, your screen will flicker or darken briefly to let you know that the screenshot has been taken. However, sometimes there‚Äôs no obvious sign that screenshot worked, so you‚Äôll have to look in your storage to make sure it was taken. Note that if you aren‚Äôt using the Fn key, make sure that the key is not illuminated or turned on: On some laptops, a lit Fn key will prevent the screenshot process from working properly because Windows registers three keys instead of two (same with Caps lock, etc.).
Microsoft‚Äôs OneDrive will typically save the screen automatically in the OneDrive folder. You will now be able to find it there, in Pictures, under Screenshots (the Screenshots folder may appear if this is your first one). You can go here to open the file and rename it if you wish. If you have Dropbox installed, the screenshot may also be automatically deposited in your Dropbox directory, under Screenshots (ideal for your ‚ÄúShowcase ‚Äú).
Step 2: Open Paint Check out your screenshot in the Screenshots folder. If you like it just the way it is, great! You can save it, move it, attach it to an email, and upload it wherever you need. However, for many screenshots you may also want to crop or alter it in some way. There are many programs that can do this, but the one closest at hand is the long-suffering Microsoft Paint .
As long as you‚Äôre running the latest version of Windows 10 , type ‚ÄúPaint‚Äù into the Windows search bar and click the corresponding result.
Step 3: Paste the screenshot Once Paint is open, click the Paste button in the upper-left corner of the program, or press Ctrl + V on the keyboard to paste your screenshot. You should see the image you captured appear in your edit windows in Paint.
From there, perform any edits you want, including cropping or selecting a certain part of it.
Step 4: Save the screenshot Click the main File option in the upper-left corner, followed by Save as .
Title the new file, choose a save location, and select your desired file format from the drop-down menu. For most purposes, JPG will do fine, but a variety of other formats are available to choose from such as PNG, BMP, GIF and others. Click the gray Save button in the bottom-right corner when finished.
And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre done.
Alternatives: The Snipping Tool The best alternative method is the Windows 10 Snipping Tool. The built-in screen capture utility in Windows works well enough, but it‚Äôs not the most robust or versatile when it comes to saving a snapshot of your screen. The Snipping Tool, however, is a utility that allows users to better define and capture portions of their desktop display as a screenshot, without the need for a keyboard.
To start, just type Snipping Tool into the Windows 10 search bar and select it to open it up. From there, it‚Äôll give you options such as drawing a Free-form Snip, a Windows Snip, or a Rectangular Snip . You can even set it to delay a certain amount of time if you‚Äôre trying to capture a precise moment in a video or animation. You can then take repeated snips in the same mode simply by pressing the Alt and N keys.
The Snipping Tool continues to gain new functionality as well. For example, it can now use image editing functions to create the Snip & Sketch application. Any time you take a screenshot it will automatically appear as a thumbnail ‚Äî like MacOS Mojave does ‚Äî so that you can then take it straight to the Snip & Sketch app for easy editing. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that Microsoft has said (via a message in the Snipping Tool app itself) that the Snipping Tool ‚Äúwill be moving to a new home‚Äù in a future Windows update. But the technology company does encourage users to ‚Äúsnip like usual‚Äù with the new Snip & Sketch app.
You also can try pressing the Windows Key + Shift + S together to activate the Snip & Sketch application without having to open it. Like in MacOS, it will darken the screen, and allow you to select where you want to snip, and then save the image to the clipboard for transferring to Paint or other applications.
If you want even more options for choosing and customizing your screenshot (and don‚Äôt mind downloading a new app), we suggest giving LightShot a try . LightShot may be a better option for more professional work, or screenshots that need significant editing.

71,alt-right,Watch John Lewis Christmas advert featuring Excitable Edgar the dragon in full - Mirror Online,"The joint Waitrose and John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 is finally here - and it&apos;s a treat for those seeking a return to the heart-warming ads of old. This year&apos;s visual delight sees Edgar the excitable green dragon teaming up with his best friend Ava in the run-up to Christmas.
The animated dragon can&apos;t contain his excitement for Christmas, resulting in total disaster every time he&apos;s introduced to the other people living in their historical village.
As Edgar and Ava join a group of children to build a snowman, Edgar attempts to stick a carrot on his chilly pal - but instead lets slip a puff of flame, instantly melting the kids&apos; creation.

Meet Excitable Edgar&apos;s best pal Ava Unimpressed, the children stand with the arms crossed, looking annoyed at Edgar.
The next scene sees the villagers enjoying their ice-rink, skating round merrily under the crisp winter sky.
But once again, Edgar&apos;s excitement leads to destruction when he accidentally lights up the rink, sending the villagers into freezing slush.
Edgar&apos;s third chance of behaving himself comes when the whole community gathers in the village square to admire the lavishly decorated Christmas tree and the pretty lights.

Close to tears, Edgar flees from the village, locking himself up at home so he can&apos;t bother anyone else.
It looks like that Edgar is going to give Christmas a miss despite it seemingly being his favourite time of the year.
However, Ava is determined to give Edgar the Christmas he&apos;s so desperate to enjoy, and knocks on his door bearing a wrapped gift - although her friend is too ashamed to see her.
The villagers can&apos;t believe Edgar has ruined their Christmas tree (Image: PA) Drastic action is required (Image: PA) John Lewis Christmas advert music confirmed as REO Speedwagon&apos;s Can&apos;t Fight This Feeling The last scene of the advert shows the villagers getting together for their annual Christmas feast, with tables groaning under the weight of all their food.
Ava blows a bugle to announce the arrival of their guest of honour - but as Edgar walks in, everyone dives for cover.
Is this the moment that Christmas dinner is going to become deep and crisp and even with another blast from Edgar&apos;s fiery nostrils?
It&apos;s not until the dragon unveils the present Ava has given him that they breathe a sigh of relief: a perfectly shaped Christmas pudding gleams in his paws.

It cost an estimated ¬£8million and was filmed over two weeks in Bulgaria.
Loving little Ava is played by 10-year-old schoolgirl Ruby Dailly, who comes from Glasgow.
Ruby was chosen from thousands of youngsters for the role.

72,alt-right,A former scientist at one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs top food startups just landed $3.5 million to take on a $240 billion market using tools from Big Pharma | Business Insider,"Shiru founder and CEO Jasmin Hume (right) and Deena Shakir of Lux Capital. Courtesy Lux Capital A food startup focused on protein just raised $3.5 million from VC firm Lux Capital, the company told Business Insider exclusively. The company, called Shiru, is led by a scientist who spent 2.5 years at Silicon Valley food startup Just . ""What I'm interested in is unlocking the actual chemistry of how and why proteins behave,"" she told Business Insider. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more.
It's one thing to make a plant-based burger that tastes like the real thing.
Swap the ground beef for a carefully-designed mixture of tasty carbs, fats, and proteins, and voila: a patty that's ready for a fast-food grill .
But making a viable alternative to yogurt and cheese ‚Äî prized for their delicate mouth-feel, smooth texture, and consistency ‚Äî is a trickier task.
Jasmin Hume, the founder of a new food startup called Shiru, just raised $3.5 million to tackle that mission. The funding round was led by venture firm Lux Capital, known for backing high-tech startups with lofty ambitions that may take years to materialize. In addition to hiring a foundational team, Shiru will start piloting its first protein product: an ingredient that could be used in alternatives for cheese, yogurt, milk, eggs, or even meat, Hume said.
Protein startups are hot these days, evidence perhaps of a new and more agnostic approach emerging in the plant-based industry that involves focusing on one ingredient (protein) instead of one type of food (meat or cheese).

In February, a startup called Sustainable Bioproducts launched with a focus on leveraging a ""super protein"" discovered in Yellowstone's volcanic hot springs. A few months later, another protein-focused venture called Emergy Foods said it had closed a $4.8 million funding round to turn fungi into filets .
Also participating in Shiru's funding round is food venture firm S2G, which backed the newly-public plant-based burger company Beyond Meat and a protein startup called MycoTechnology. The venture firm CPT Capital, backers of the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods and the protein startup Motif Foodworks, and also participated.
Hume previously served as the director of food chemistry for Just , one of the best-funded plant-based food startups in Silicon Valley (and formerly known as Hampton Creek). Deena Shakir , who joined Lux as its newest investment partner in August, is joining Shiru's board. 'Focusing on function first' Shiru founder and CEO, Jasmin Hume, spent 2.5 years at food startup Just and has a doctorate in protein engineering from NYU. Courtesy Jasmin Hume
Shiru will build a database of unique proteins that can be readily swapped into various animal-based foods, Hume said. The company launched publicly at the tech-startup accelerator Y Combinator in August.
The idea is to identify non-animal proteins that are perfectly suited to fit into a recipe for a given food product.
""We're focusing on function first: for example, why are you using that protein in that particular product,"" Hume said.
That's the opposite approach to the one taken by the majority of today's dominant food startups, which mostly plug in various plant or fungi ingredients into traditional dairy, egg, or meat-based recipes and then iterate from there.
Because Shiru isn't putting a stake in one particular kind of food, it has the potential to disrupt an entire class of animal-based products.
The plant-based milk market alone is worth $18 billion globally , according to a report from analytics firm CB Insights. Meat is a roughly $200 billion industry , the North American Meat Institute says, and cheese is worth nearly $17 billion , according to market research company IMARC.
Hume knows the alternative food space better than most, having spent 2.5 years at Just and a year as a consultant to other food startups. Hume also has a doctorate in protein engineering from New York University and a master's degree in materials engineering from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. Additionally, she spent a summer as an intern at Lux. Taking a page from the drug development playbook Shiru
In the next six months, Hume aims for Shiru to develop its first food product: something Hume would only identify as an ""extremely versatile"" ingredient that could be used in alternatives for dairy, eggs, or meat.
To do it, she's taking a page from the drug discovery playbook ‚Äî where a drug company might use its computational tools to pinpoint new molecules whose structure makes them well-suited to a potential new drug, Shiru is using the same approach to find molecules whose structure makes them well-suited to a potential new food.
When it comes to taste and nutrition, plant-based cheeses and yogurts have lagged behind their meat-like counterparts. Meat-free ground beef has existed for decades; more recently, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have broken ground with ready-to-eat fast-food patties available at places like Burger King and Carl's Jr.
Hume said that spending time at several existing food startups helped her see a potential reason for this. While many companies succeed at making large quantities of high-quality plant- or fungi-based proteins, they encounter difficulties when it comes to turning those proteins into scramble-ready eggs or meltable cheese.
""Pea protein isn't designed to behave like an egg protein,"" Hume said.
Hume, who is vegetarian, said she'd like to completely eliminate animal-based products from her diet and go vegan. But she's waiting on viable cheese and yogurt alternatives to make the switch, which is part of the reason she started Shiru.
""What I'm interested in is unlocking the actual chemistry of how and why proteins behave,"" Hume said.

Obtain a good domain name</h2> <p>Your domain name, also known as your website address, is often the entry point to your site. It is important that it makes a good impression for usability purposes, as well as for search engine optimization (SEO).</p> <p>Here are some tips for coming up with an optimal domain name:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Make it easy to spell. ;</strong>Try not to use slang, made up, or extremely esoteric words.</li> <div class=""vestpocket"" vest-pocket></div> <li><strong>Keep it as short as possible. ;</strong>The shorter it is, the easier it is to remember and type correctly.</li> <li><strong>Use the proper domain extension. ;</strong>Try to always make it a .com domain name (as opposed to .net, .co, etc.) unless it is more appropriate to use another extension, such as .gov, .edu, or .org.</li> <li><strong>Avoid numbers and hyphens. ;</strong>They are hard to remember and less elegant and memorable than word-only domain names, and may be misunderstood when vocalizing the domain name.</li> <li><strong>Make the address broad to facilitate future growth. ;</strong>For example, Amazon.com is a much broader website address than BooksOnline.com and allows Amazon to sell pretty much every type of consumer good instead of books only, as was its original purpose.</li> <li><strong>Ensure it is memorable. ;</strong>With so many websites on the internet, it is important that your website name is catchy so people will remember how to access it in the future.</li> <li><strong>Research the domain name. ;</strong>Google it to see if a similar website address already exists online, and search on <a href=""https://www.uspto.gov/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.uspto.gov/"">USPTO.gov</a> ;to make sure it does not contain any registered trademarks.</li> <li><strong>Check if the price is right. ;</strong>Determine if you can purchase your desired website address at a reasonable price since most good domain names are taken and will need to be bought from the current owner.</li> <li><strong>Avoid nonsensical names. </strong>Choose a name that conveys a meaning so that users will know immediately what your business is. Yahoo and Google are catchy names, but they were very expensive to brand, and your small business may not have the same budget.</li> <li><strong>Create an SEO-friendly URL. </strong>When appropriate, try to come up with an SEO-friendly website address that includes keywords and geo-location; for example, ‚Äúwww.LasVegasElectrician.com.‚Äù</li> </ul> <h2>2. Purchase secure, scalable website hosting with good tech support</h2> <p>A website host (or sometimes referred to as a website hosting provider) is a company that offers the technology and services necessary for a website to be viewed on the internet. You connect your domain name to your hosting provider so that when users visit your website address, they are shown your website that you store on your hosting account.</p> <p>Hosting services can cost anywhere between $2 to $100+ per month, depending on the kind of technology and support you choose. You can usually get a discount if you purchase a yearly plan as opposed to a monthly plan.</p> <p>Here are some guidelines for choosing a good website hosting plan:</p> <ul> <li>Although you can get a <strong>‚Äúshared server‚Äù ;</strong>hosting plan for as little as $2 per month, I would typically advise against this. Shared hosting means you are sharing a server and its resources with other customers, which can make the performance of your site suffer. Also, if one of the other websites on your shared server is hacked, it is possible for your website to also be infected.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>A <strong>‚Äúdedicated server‚Äù ;</strong>hosting plan is the most expensive option‚Äîcost can range from around $100 to $2,000 per month‚Äîbut it would make your website perform the most optimally. Having a dedicated server plan means that the physical server machine is entirely dedicated to your site; therefore, all the resources are yours and it is more secure than a shared hosting plan, as long as the technology is optimal. However, it is much more expensive than what most small businesses usually are willing to pay. Once you have a very high-performing site, this may be what you need, but it is overkill for most early stage and small businesses.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The compromise I typically recommend is a <strong>‚Äúvirtual private server‚Äù (VPS) ;</strong>hosting plan which offers the best of both worlds. The cost ranges from around $20 to $50 per month, which is affordable for the hosting services you will receive. A VPS is one machine that is partitioned to act as multiple machines, which gives it a similar affordability to shared hosting, with similar security and performance potential as a dedicated server hosting plan.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Make sure your hosting company has <strong>phone and/or chat support ;</strong>so you can be helped quickly if you have a problem. Email support can often take too long and become frustrating when a problem needs to be resolved immediately. Phone support is best, but chatting works well, too.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>There needs to be an <strong>easy to use server interface like cPanel </strong>to access your server. You do not want to have to use terminal commands to view your server contents and make changes, unless you can afford to hire a professional server administrator to help you.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Check to see what kind of <strong>server security ;</strong>is in place on the server you are considering. You will want to be able to access your server via Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). There should be daily backups being made of your server contents. There should also be an easy, one or two-click method to install Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates. Make sure the hosting company performs regular security maintenance. Ideally your hosting company has a published security protocol you can review so you know how they keep their servers safe.</li> </ul> <p>Some popular website hosting companies include:</p> <ul> <li><a href=""https://www.godaddy.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.godaddy.com/"">GoDaddy</a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.dreamhost.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.dreamhost.com/"">DreamHost</a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.bluehost.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.bluehost.com/"">Bluehost</a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.inmotionhosting.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.inmotionhosting.com/"">InMotion</a></li> <li><a href=""https://www.siteground.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.siteground.com/"">SiteGround</a></li> </ul> <h2>3. Prominently display a clear description of your business</h2> <p>It is important to let people know who you are and what you do right away so they don‚Äôt feel confused when they visit your small business website. Make sure your main homepage banner (also known as a ‚Äúhero image‚Äù) and subsequent banners are visual representations of your services, and also that you have an introductory text blurb near the top of the page that describes who you are and what you do.</p> <p>Additionally, make sure both your main and footer navigation menus have ""About Us"" page links easily accessible so people can click them and read more about your business in depth.</p> <h2>4. Implement the best content management system</h2> <p>A content management system (CMS) is a software program or application that is used to create and manage digital content. A good CMS will help you maintain your site, and you don‚Äôt need much technical knowledge to use it. You should choose a CMS that is designed for your unique needs; different systems are used for different reasons, such as user-friendliness, extensibility, and budget.</p> <p>The following are some popular systems with descriptions of their strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p><strong>WordPress:</strong><em> ;</em><a href=""https://wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://wordpress.com/"">WordPress</a> ;is the world‚Äôs most popular CMS. It has a vast, active support community and many useful plugins to extend the functionality of your site. (And if you cannot find a plugin that does what you want, it is easy to find a WordPress developer who can make one for you!) WordPress is also free and relatively simple to install. Most website developers are familiar with it so it is not hard to find an individual or agency that can work on your site. I normally recommend that small businesses use WordPress to create their websites, due to its flexibility and extensibility.</p> <p>It must be noted, however, that WordPress's biggest weakness is security‚Äîbecause it is so popular, hackers target it the most. Your WordPress site needs to be regularly maintained and secured so it is not hacked. Also, it is difficult to secure every single third-party plugin, so keeping your WordPress site secure must be an ongoing commitment through various best practices (checking to see if your plugins have been updated within the past few months, making sure it is a plugin provided in the official WordPress repository, deleting unused plugins immediately, etc.).</p> <p><strong>Drupal: </strong><a href=""https://www.drupal.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.drupal.org/"">Drupal</a> ;is another popular CMS. It offers many of the same benefits as WordPress, including flexibility, ease of use, and a large support community. Notably it is a more secure CMS than WordPress (safer from malicious activity); however, it doesn‚Äôt have as many plugin or theme options, which makes it less extensible. For many years, the White House website (Whitehouse.gov) was run with Drupal, but has since switched to WordPress, which it still uses today.</p> <p><strong>Joomla!: ;</strong>Another popular CMS is <a href=""https://www.joomla.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.joomla.org/"">Joomla!</a> ;Out of the box, it has better SEO, security, and multilingual capabilities than WordPress; however, with the help of a few plugins, WordPress surpasses Joomla!‚Äôs capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Squarespace: ;</strong><a href=""https://www.squarespace.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.squarespace.com/"">Squarespace</a> ;is a service you subscribe to monthly or annually that makes website and blog creation an easy ‚Äúdrag and drop‚Äù experience. It includes website design, development, software maintenance, metrics, domain name with annual purchase, SSL security, 24/7 support, and unlimited bandwidth and storage hosting all in one package. It is especially suitable for creatives and provides you with top-notch design templates. If you are on a tight budget, need a simple and beautiful site, but cannot afford a website designer, this is a great service for you.</p> <p>There is a much smaller learning curve with Squarespace than with WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla!, but it doesn‚Äôt have nearly as many extensibility options. However, if you have little or no technical knowledge and are looking for a quick and easy way to put up a website, Squarespace is an excellent option for you.</p> <p><strong>Wix: ;</strong><a href=""https://www.wix.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.wix.com/"">Wix</a> ;is very similar to Squarespace, but it is a bit more user-friendly. It offers a monthly, but not annual, subscription and includes similar features. Wix is also a drag-and-drop builder‚Äîyou can freely drag and drop elements anywhere on the page; in comparison, Squarespace is more structured in where you can drag and drop on the page. ;The learning curve to using Wix is even shorter than Squarespace, so if you need to publish a site quickly, this may be your best option.</p> <p>Wix has a lot more templates than Squarespace to choose from, but once you choose a template, you must stick with it or be forced to completely rebuild your site. With Squarespace, you can change your template anytime without having to rebuild the entire site.<strong> ;</strong></p> <h2>5. Choose a good e-commerce platform</h2> <p>If you plan on selling goods and/or services through your website, you will need the right technology to do so. (If you do not currently sell anything, you may want to consider doing so since e-commerce could potentially increase your profits.) If you decide to allow users to financially transact with you online, you will need to choose the right platform for your business model.</p> <p>Here are some popular small business e-commerce platforms:</p> <p><strong>WooCommerce: ;</strong><a href=""https://woocommerce.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://woocommerce.com/"">WooCommerce</a> ;is one of the world‚Äôs most popular e-commerce platforms‚Äîit can turn your WordPress website into an online store. Like WordPress, there are many plugins available, and it attaches to WordPress, which makes it extremely flexible. There are many free and premium themes pre-built for WooCommerce. (As a rule, it is better to use a premium theme from a reputable developer because it will offer better security and support.) If you are not tech-savvy, you will most likely need a WordPress developer to help you set it up and use it. WooCommerce also offers a very high amount of capabilities and scalability that your small business might need.</p> <p><strong>Shopify: ;</strong><a href=""https://www.shopify.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.shopify.com/"">Shopify</a> ;is a cloud based e-commerce platform that allows you to create and customize an online store, and to manage products, inventory, payments, and shipping. It is not a WordPress extension like WooCommerce‚Äîit is a standalone platform that is hosted on the Shopify server‚Äîso if you have a main website, your e-commerce site would technically be separate from that. You can link to your Shopify account from your regular website built with WordPress, Drupal, Wix, etc., unless your main website has a Shopify integration plugin.</p> <p>Features include unlimited products, unlimited bandwidth, fraud analysis, discount codes, reports, and much more. The key benefits of Shopify are that you do not need a developer to set up a store, and everything on the backend is already set up for you when you subscribe. The downside is you do not have as much control or flexibility over your store as you would with WooCommerce.</p> <p><strong>Shopify Plus: ;</strong><a href=""https://www.shopify.com/plus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.shopify.com/plus"">Shopify Plus</a> ;is Shopify, but with a higher level of customization, more staff accounts, and international e-commerce options. It also has a higher level of support. However, all of this obviously comes with a higher subscription cost, and it still does not have all the flexibility and customization abilities as WooCommerce.</p> <p><strong>Business Squarespace: ;</strong>Squarespace has an e-commerce subscription option, so if you chose Squarespace to build your site and have very simple e-commerce needs, you can choose this route. Business Squarespace charges a transaction fee, but this can be bypassed by upgrading your subscription to a basic online store. It includes a free domain, SSL security, SEO, abandoned cart recovery, discounts, real-time carrier shipping, and more. However, it has been noted it is not as user-friendly as Shopify. And like Shopify, it is simply not as flexible as WooCommerce.</p> <p><strong>Wix: ;</strong>Wix actually has a Shopify extension which is very user friendly.

Create an interesting, memorable, and engaging website user interface</h2> <p>Make sure your small business website interface leaves a positive impression that drives results. You can do so by implementing the following suggestions:</p> <ul> <li>Use beautiful graphics and easy-to-read fonts.</li> <li>Make sure your graphics are compressed and optimized for fast loading. If your website is slow, search engines like Google will penalize your ranking.</li> <li>Research the competition to see how they have designed and optimized their websites; implement similar components that will work for your small business website.</li> <li>Research your target audience to see what they want from your site and make it easy for them to accomplish it.</li> <li>Stay consistently on brand throughout your website design.</li> <li>Design an intuitive navigation system which allows users to get to the pages they need quickly.</li> <li>Publish easily accessible contact information.</li> <li>Incorporate obvious call-to-actions (especially ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù buttons).</li> <li>Create pages that are standard for small business websites, such as: <ul> <li>Home</li> <li>About us</li> <li>Products/Services (with descriptions and visually appealing images)</li> <li>Sitemap (for SEO purposes)</li> <li>Management team</li> <li>Contact us</li> <li>Terms of use (the online contract governing how users can use your site)</li> <li>Privacy policy</li> <li>Additional pages relevant to your specific small business</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>7. Optimize your small business website for search engines</h2> <p>SEO is a set of practices you apply to your website to ensure search engines index and rank your website appropriately and then show it to search engine users. Once your website is ‚Äúcrawled‚Äù by search engines, it competes with websites that have similar content. The better your website design and content is, the higher your site will show up on search engine result pages.</p> <p>SEO mainly includes the following practices:</p> <ul> <li>Keyword research and implementation</li> <li>Optimal website code</li> <li>Fast loading speed</li> <li>Being secure and having an SSL certificate installed; SSL is the standard security technology that ensures data passed between web servers and browsers remains private</li> <li>Having a mobile-friendly site</li> <li>Existence of high-quality backlinks (links on external websites with related content) that lead to your site</li> <li>Having lots of positive reviews online (Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc.)</li> <li>Using internal links throughout your site to keep people clicking and reading</li> <li>Using social media to link to your site (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>SEO is an extremely important ongoing process that can mean the difference between showing up on the first page of search engine results pages (resulting in large amounts of free traffic to your website) or page 300 (resulting in no traffic).</p> <h2>8. Regularly create and publish quality content</h2> <p>Both content quantity and freshness are important to search engines, so it‚Äôs important that you create a plan to publish quality articles and/or blog posts on your site and on external sites that link to your site. If you want to rank highly in search engine results and encourage people to return to your site again and again, you will have to update your website with new and relevant content as frequently as possible.</p> <p>In addition to static page content and articles, a great form of content to post on your website is testimonials. Asking for testimonials from your customers and then publishing them on your website is a great way to post fresh, high-quality content on your site that makes your small business more attractive.</p> <p>Make sure your content uses an appropriate, on-brand tone that people will enjoy reading.</p> <h2>9. Install webmaster tools</h2> <p>Make use of vital data to help you analyze traffic and site performance by installing <a href=""https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"">Google Analytics</a> ;and <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console/about"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://search.google.com/search-console/about"">Google Search Console</a> ;(both preferably via Google Tag Manager), and <a href=""https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-ga-track=""ExternalLink:https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster"">Bing Webmaster Tools</a>. These tools can be used to track the following types of information:</p> <ul> <li>Daily, weekly, and monthly visitors to your site</li> <li>Number of views on each page of your site</li> <li>‚ÄúBounce rate‚Äù‚Äîthe percentage of users who come to your site and leave after having only viewed one page (Google algorithms give higher rankings to websites that have a low bounce rate, on the theory that visitors are spending more time on the site and find it valuable.)</li> <li>Average time spent on site by visitors</li> <li>Crawl errors on your site (errors that the search engines found on your site in crawling its content)</li> <li>Broken links on the site</li> <li>Keywords that lead users to your site</li> <li>Backlinks to your site</li> <li>Web page download time</li> <li>Other information that can help you enhance your SEO</li> </ul> <h2>10. Implement a website maintenance plan</h2> <p>A website shouldn‚Äôt be created and then allowed to grow stale. In order to have a successful website that ranks well in search engines and doesn't get hacked, you need to make sure it is properly maintained.</p> <p>Here are some tips to create a small business website maintenance plan:</p> <ul> <li>Check Webmaster Tools data at least once a month and have any vital errors emailed to you in real time.</li> <li>Use traffic data to learn more about your audience so you can better cater to them.</li> <li>Use performance data to optimize and fix warnings and errors.</li> <li>Make sure all software is always up to date.</li> <li>Run security scans so you know your website is clean of malware and hasn‚Äôt been hacked.</li> <li>Use ‚Äúsplit testing‚Äù to see if certain variations of your website help performance; for example, if you are selling a product, you might have two versions of a particular landing page with different images and wording‚Äîthe split testing allows you to see which version has a higher conversion rate.</li> <li>Follow my advice about SEO (see point #7), and continually publish quality content (see point #8).</li> <li>Find on-trend and effective ways to market your business online.</li> <li>Allow website users to provide you with feedback about your site.</li> <li>Continue to check out your competition from time to time to see what they are doing with their online presence and see if what they‚Äôve done can work for you as well.</li> <li>Make sure your website is backed up in multiple ways at least once a day and at least 10 days back.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>As you can tell after reading this article, creating a great small business website may not be as simple as you first thought.

Prominently display a clear description of your business
It is important to let people know who you are and what you do right away so they don‚Äôt feel confused when they visit your small business website. Make sure your main homepage banner (also known as a ‚Äúhero image‚Äù) and subsequent banners are visual representations of your services, and also that you have an introductory text blurb near the top of the page that describes who you are and what you do.
Additionally, make sure both your main and footer navigation menus have ""About Us"" page links easily accessible so people can click them and read more about your business in depth. 4. Implement the best content management system
A content management system (CMS) is a software program or application that is used to create and manage digital content. A good CMS will help you maintain your site, and you don‚Äôt need much technical knowledge to use it. You should choose a CMS that is designed for your unique needs; different systems are used for different reasons, such as user-friendliness, extensibility, and budget.
The following are some popular systems with descriptions of their strengths and weaknesses.
WordPress: WordPress is the world‚Äôs most popular CMS. It has a vast, active support community and many useful plugins to extend the functionality of your site. (And if you cannot find a plugin that does what you want, it is easy to find a WordPress developer who can make one for you!) WordPress is also free and relatively simple to install. Most website developers are familiar with it so it is not hard to find an individual or agency that can work on your site. I normally recommend that small businesses use WordPress to create their websites, due to its flexibility and extensibility.
It must be noted, however, that WordPress's biggest weakness is security‚Äîbecause it is so popular, hackers target it the most. Your WordPress site needs to be regularly maintained and secured so it is not hacked. Also, it is difficult to secure every single third-party plugin, so keeping your WordPress site secure must be an ongoing commitment through various best practices (checking to see if your plugins have been updated within the past few months, making sure it is a plugin provided in the official WordPress repository, deleting unused plugins immediately, etc.).
Drupal: Drupal is another popular CMS. It offers many of the same benefits as WordPress, including flexibility, ease of use, and a large support community. Notably it is a more secure CMS than WordPress (safer from malicious activity); however, it doesn‚Äôt have as many plugin or theme options, which makes it less extensible. For many years, the White House website (Whitehouse.gov) was run with Drupal, but has since switched to WordPress, which it still uses today.
Joomla!: Another popular CMS is Joomla! Out of the box, it has better SEO, security, and multilingual capabilities than WordPress; however, with the help of a few plugins, WordPress surpasses Joomla!‚Äôs capabilities.
Squarespace: Squarespace is a service you subscribe to monthly or annually that makes website and blog creation an easy ‚Äúdrag and drop‚Äù experience. It includes website design, development, software maintenance, metrics, domain name with annual purchase, SSL security, 24/7 support, and unlimited bandwidth and storage hosting all in one package. It is especially suitable for creatives and provides you with top-notch design templates. If you are on a tight budget, need a simple and beautiful site, but cannot afford a website designer, this is a great service for you.
There is a much smaller learning curve with Squarespace than with WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla!, but it doesn‚Äôt have nearly as many extensibility options. However, if you have little or no technical knowledge and are looking for a quick and easy way to put up a website, Squarespace is an excellent option for you.
Wix: Wix is very similar to Squarespace, but it is a bit more user-friendly. It offers a monthly, but not annual, subscription and includes similar features. Wix is also a drag-and-drop builder‚Äîyou can freely drag and drop elements anywhere on the page; in comparison, Squarespace is more structured in where you can drag and drop on the page. The learning curve to using Wix is even shorter than Squarespace, so if you need to publish a site quickly, this may be your best option.
Wix has a lot more templates than Squarespace to choose from, but once you choose a template, you must stick with it or be forced to completely rebuild your site. With Squarespace, you can change your template anytime without having to rebuild the entire site. 5. Choose a good e-commerce platform
If you plan on selling goods and/or services through your website, you will need the right technology to do so. (If you do not currently sell anything, you may want to consider doing so since e-commerce could potentially increase your profits.) If you decide to allow users to financially transact with you online, you will need to choose the right platform for your business model.

And like Shopify, it is simply not as flexible as WooCommerce.
Wix: Wix actually has a Shopify extension which is very user friendly. You will have to upgrade your Wix account and subscribe to Shopify in order to use it.
GoDaddy Online Store: GoDaddy has a relatively new e-commerce standalone subscription platform that is relatively easy to set up and use. Very little technical knowledge is required to launch your shop with GoDaddy Online Store . The templates are simple and clean, and somewhat customizable.

75,billionaire,Trump rally attendees leave early as president‚Äôs rambling drags into second hour,"Those attending President Donald Trump‚Äôs rally in Monroe, Louisiana seemed to be unwilling to continue on with the rally as it entered its second hour of Trump speaking.
The president was scheduled to begin speaking at 7 p.m. CDT, but as the rally went into 9 p.m. NBC News correspondent took a video showing that supporters began streaming out of the arena. ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe president is speaking and you can see folks streaming out of the arena. It‚Äôs just unusual for his rally events. Those who remain are fired up,‚Äù Kelly O‚ÄôDonnell tweeted Wednesday night.
Most Trump rally attendees arrive hours ahead of time and must wait in long lines. They then enter the rally site where there are more hours of speeches ahead of the president. Some people simply can‚Äôt go on that long.

76,billionaire,Lindsey Graham to Pat Robertson: ‚ÄòI‚Äôll become Trump‚Äôs worst nightmare‚Äô if he doesn‚Äôt stop slaughter of Kurds,"During an appearance on the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) this Wednesday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) reiterated his defense of the Kurds in Syria and took his criticism of President Trump a step further, saying he‚Äôll become Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúworst nightmare‚Äù if Turkey is allowed to continue its incursion into the country‚Äôs northeast region. ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking to televangelist and CBN founder Pat Robertson, Graham said that if Christians are not praying for the Kurds, ‚Äúwe should all be ashamed of ourselves.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was the Kurds who worked with the America military to destroy ISIS,‚Äù Graham said. ‚ÄúIf we abandon the Kurds, it will be dishonorable, it will be a disaster.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am looking to President Trump to change this,‚Äù Graham continued. ‚ÄúI will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump‚Äôs worst nightmare. I will not sit along the sidelines and watch our good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey and watch Iran move in to Syria and become another nightmare for Israel. This is a defining moment for President Trump ‚Äî he needs to up his game.‚Äù

78,billionaire,Welcome to Manc-hattan: how the city sold its soul for luxury skyscrapers | Art and design | The Guardian,"Giant towers are sprouting up all over Manchester. But how will sky lounges and penthouse olive groves help the city‚Äôs rocketing homelessness problem?. ‚ÄòH ell upon Earth ‚Äù is how Friedrich Engels described Manchester‚Äôs Angel Meadow. This violent, squalid, disease-ridden district was one of the worst slums the revolutionary German thinker encountered on his tour of Victorian England. Everything about the place, he wrote in 1844, ‚Äúarouses horror and indignation‚Äù.
Visiting today, he might be tempted to use the same words, for very different reasons. On either side of the leafy park, which undulates over the graves of 40,000 Victorian paupers, the bulky concrete frames of new apartment blocks are beginning to rise. They will ultimately become 17- and 22-storey slabs that will in turn be dwarfed by a 41-storey tower, all surrounding the park with a glacial wall of ‚Äúultra-sleek urban homes‚Äù. And not a single one affordable.
This is MeadowSide , a ¬£200m development by the Far East Consortium, a Hong Kong developer registered in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. This site ‚Äì once the gateway to medieval Manchester and depicted in the paintings of LS Lowry ‚Äì is being ripped up to make way for 756 luxury homes, many already sold off-plan to investors in Hong Kong. Brochures in the marketing suite describe it as a place ‚Äúwhere glass meets grass and concrete meets conkers‚Äù. It‚Äôs also where the forces of international capital meet a city seemingly open to investment at any cost.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick of my city being strip-mined,‚Äù says Sam Wheeler, councillor for the Piccadilly ward, where the blocks are sprouting. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to trash the nature of the area, but you‚Äôre doing it to address the housing crisis, maybe we could have a conversation. But these schemes aren‚Äôt even providing the homes Manchester desperately needs.‚Äù
According to government figures , there are now almost 2,000 households living homeless in temporary accommodation in Manchester, a six-fold increase over the last five years. The city‚Äôs homeless population is more than 4,000, the highest rate in northern England, and nearly 13,500 households are on the social housing waiting list. How many social homes were built last year? Just 28.
Yet Manchester is visibly booming. Cranes cluster across the skyline and the concrete liftshafts of future towers dot every corner. The city is even beginning to look drunk on its own success. Brash billboards herald the latest luxury lifestyle concepts: Moda Angel Gardens offers a rooftop sports pitch, cinema and ‚Äúsky lounge‚Äù, with every aspect of its residents‚Äô lives managed through an app.
Oxygen will have five-star hotel facilities and ‚Äúbreathtaking views of a rising global destination‚Äù. The brassy Axis Tower , which looks as if the architect‚Äôs screen crashed halfway through designing the facade, is ‚Äúa true epitome of exclusivity and architectural grandeur‚Äù. Despite the council having a policy of 20% affordable housing in all new developments, none of these schemes provide any.

As the Guardian revealed last year , across the 61 big residential developments granted permission by Manchester‚Äôs planning committee over the previous two years, not one of the 14,667 homes met the government‚Äôs definition of affordable, being neither for social rent nor offered at 80% of the market rate. The flood of steroidal schemes that have been rubber-stamped in the lust for growth is now becoming very visible: this is the most radical physical transformation of any UK city for some time.
At the forefront is Deansgate Square , a quartet of enormous grey glass towers that will stand like a defensive battery against the estates of Hulme to the south of the centre. Rising to a whopping 64 storeys, the development is billed as ‚Äúa new level‚Äù. Manchester City‚Äôs star striker Sergio Ag√ºero has already snapped up a penthouse.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taller than anything I imagined was going to happen here,‚Äù says the project‚Äôs architect, Ian Simpson. He sounds almost surprised at what he has been allowed to do, dwelling on the tallest of the Deansgate four. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the city‚Äôs first proper skyscraper, at over 200 metres.‚Äù On his desk is a model of the area around Great Jackson Street, showing where the Deansgate shafts will take their place ‚Äì among a cluster of 25 other towers , the composition of which Simpson also planned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a mini Manhattan,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs starting to create a real skyline, which Manchester has never had.‚Äù
Posters have already appeared announcing the birth of ‚ÄúManc-hattan‚Äù . But the truth is we are a long way from that uplifting skyline. This is more like something you‚Äôd see on the outer ring road of a third-tier Chinese city.

The flanks of the Deansgate towers now loom above Simpson‚Äôs office, located in a converted warehouse. Simpson can‚Äôt escape them at home either. He lives in a huge duplex ‚Äì complete with its own olive grove ‚Äì at the top of nearby Beetham Tower . Completed in 2006, Beetham is itself 47 storeys tall, making it, until last year, the city‚Äôs tallest structure. ‚ÄúLooking out at night,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúall I see is red aircraft warning lights.‚Äù
It sounds like an irritant, but for Simpson this red panorama symbolises the realisation of his quest to make Manchester a mecca for high-rise, city-centre living. ‚ÄúManchester‚Äôs city core had about 400 people living in it when the IRA bomb went off in 1996,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs got about 35,000. I‚Äôd like it to have 200,000, because the one thing the city needs is people. That drives everything else.‚Äù
Simpson says the centre ‚Äúused to be a ghetto for people who couldn‚Äôt get out‚Äù, but now it‚Äôs a desirable place ‚Äì and it needs the swanky flats to match. ‚ÄúPart of the problem,‚Äù he adds, ‚Äúis that there aren‚Äôt enough expensive homes in the city.‚Äù
Simpson believes this influx of luxury flats should be welcomed, because it means that those who would otherwise be driving in from the affluent commuter suburbs ‚Äì Altrincham, Wilmslow, Didsbury ‚Äì will now be able to live in the centre. The absence of affordable housing, he argues, is a consequence of financial viability. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really difficult to build a tall building cost-effectively. None of these developers really make super profits in Manchester. It‚Äôs not at all like London.‚Äù

Renaker, the developer-builder behind Deansgate Square and a large number of towers nearby, seems to be doing quite well out of it. In its most recent financial results, the firm reported a turnover of ¬£132.8m, up 37% on the previous year, with pre-tax profits of ¬£4.6m. Last year, it acquired the prominent Trinity Islands site , which has permission to build the tallest residential tower in western Europe. Global real estate group CBRE puts the average residential yield in Manchester at 5.8%, compared with 3% in London. As one industry source puts it: ‚ÄúThe returns are higher in Manchester ‚Äì that‚Äôs why all the money moved here.‚Äù
Dr Jonathan Silver, an urban academic, began investigating the building boom when he returned to Manchester after a few years away ‚Äì and found a homeless camp on Oxford Road, near where the first towers were sprouting.
‚ÄúIt was a very powerful juxtaposition that reminded me of cities I‚Äôd been researching in Africa,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEverything had changed. Until 2013, Manchester‚Äôs development model was quite provincial: local developers using national banks, building the schemes and selling them to individual buyers. Now it‚Äôs a tool the city is using to reinsert itself into the world economy, courting investment from China to Abu Dhabi.‚Äù He says that, since the 90s, Manchester‚Äôs mantra has been: ‚ÄúAny investment is good investment.‚Äù But times have changed, he warns, and the council needs to wake up.
Sam Wheeler agrees. ‚ÄúThere was this desperation to reverse the post-industrial decline and transform the city centre at any cost. And they did it. People have come. It‚Äôs worked. But we‚Äôre in a different situation now. The population isn‚Äôt declining and developers aren‚Äôt going to run a mile if we insist they contribute to some social housing.‚Äù
 Controversial ‚Ä¶ CGI showing St Michael‚Äôs tower, fronted by Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, and the historic monuments it will loom over. Photograph: Stephen Hodder
Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council since 1996 and much credited with turning the city around, insists the council is tough on developers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident we‚Äôve been getting the best deal we could for a long time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOur planning officers have access to robust assessment methods, but it‚Äôs still hard to make these schemes stack up financially.‚Äù He says it comes down to a choice: ‚ÄúWe either swallow green belt, or we build densely on brownfield sites. I don‚Äôt think the towers are too tall. In 20 years, people will be saying, ‚ÄòWhy did you build them so small?‚Äô‚Äù
When St Michael‚Äôs tower ‚Äì the controversial project fronted by the former footballers Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs for tycoon Peter Lim who made his fortune in palm oil ‚Äì is finally looming over the Grade I-listed town hall, it‚Äôs hard to imagine many will wish the 40-storey skyscraper had been even bigger. Leese‚Äôs argument seems disingenuous: saying no to these silos does not mean tearing up green fields around the city instead. It is perfectly possible to build mixed-tenure communities at high density on brownfield sites in a manner that fits the rest of the city. It just requires a little more effort and a decent plan ‚Äì not the current approach of filling each site to its limits and pushing for the maximum height until it hits the airport flight path.
‚ÄúThe situation is truly shameful,‚Äù says Dr Margaret Collier of the Manchester Civic Society, which crowdfunded a campaign to challenge St Michael‚Äôs tower decision. ‚ÄúThe planning system is not fit for purpose, and authorities aren‚Äôt looking with sufficient scrutiny at what‚Äôs in front of them. We‚Äôve got a wonderful historic core in Manchester. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that it has turned out to be impossible to protect it.‚Äù
If the barman, cleaner or nurse can‚Äôt get a home, it‚Äôs not their city
It seems no corner of the city is safe. In the bohemian Northern Quarter , a proposal for an angular glass stump ‚Äì which was rejected three times by councillors for being too tall ‚Äì was recently approved, despite the latest vision being the biggest yet. Dubbed the ‚Äú Shudehill Shard ‚Äù and backed by Betfred billionaire Fred Done, the project will see a 17-storey glass wedge arrive in the colourful low-rise district, once again providing no affordable housing, despite being on a council-owned site.
As Wheeler asked at the time: ‚ÄúDoes [the council] flog off some of the last, democratically controlled land in the city centre for a billionaire‚Äôs vanity project, or does it listen to local people and their representatives, and use its power to make developers act with some responsibility?‚Äù It chose the former.
There are signs, however, that Mancunians‚Äô vocal criticisms are beginning to have an impact. The first tower to include on-site affordable housing was secured earlier this year, in the form of the 30-storey Swan House , although it will still be only 5% of the total number of flats. Meanwhile, the council has started to make viability assessments public, and has introduced a ‚Äúclawback mechanism‚Äù, for when developments turn out to be more profitable than expected. The council must have the confidence to insist on truly inclusive developments, with a higher calibre of design that respects the city‚Äôs fabric, otherwise the lifeblood of Manchester, the fuel in the powerhouse‚Äôs engine, will drain away.
‚ÄúIf the barman, cleaner or nurse can‚Äôt get a home,‚Äù says Wheeler, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not their city. The people who make the city function need to be able to live here. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a particularly radical thing to ask.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Oliver Wainwright will debate these issues at Sin City? The Morality of Urban Growth , at the Fairfield Social Club, Manchester, on 22 October.

Here&apos;s what you need to know as you start your Friday ... Video Russia probe ‚Äòorigins‚Äô review now a criminal investigation, sources tell Fox News
U.S. Attorney John Durham&apos;s probe into the origins of the Russia investigation has become a criminal inquiry, two sources told Fox News on Thursday ‚Äì and an upcoming report on alleged FBI surveillance abuses against the Trump campaign will shed light on why, one source said.

‚ÄòLeaking like mad‚Äô: GOP lawmakers demand probe into release of ‚Äòhighly sensitive information,‚Äô disclose fired FBI agent‚Äôs texts to make point
Top Republicans have demanded that Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) Michael Atkinson explain why the watchdog hasn&apos;t said if it&apos;s investigating ""a number of leaks of highly sensitive information"" in recent years -- and released several previously unpublished texts and emails from since-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, specifically asked Atkinson why Strzok texted bureau colleague Lisa Page the following on Dec. 15, 2016: ""Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried and political, they&apos;re kicking into overdrive.""
Video ""What are they worried about, and what are they kicking into &apos;overdrive?&apos; Johnson and Grassley wrote. ""Who are the &apos;sisters,&apos; and what does it mean to say that the &apos;sisters have [been] leaking like mad&apos;?"" In addition, the senators pushed to know whether the ICIG was looking into Strzok&apos;s email to FBI colleagues on April 13, 2017, when he wrote that an unidentified ""agency"" might be the ""source of some of the leaks"" to the media that he&apos;d been seeing.

Trump campaign responds to Biden‚Äôs &apos;60 Minutes&apos; remarks on president‚Äôs family
The Trump 2020 campaign late Thursday night responded in a tweet to Joe Biden&apos;s upcoming ""60 Minutes"" interview in which the former vice president is critical of President Trump for allowing his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner to work in important positions from within the White House. Biden told CBS, in a report that will air Sunday night, that he ""wasn&apos;t raised to go after the children,"" but said it was a wrong decision by Trump to tap family members for positions that ‚Äúthey know nothing about.‚Äù (CBS released portions of the interview Thursday.)
Video Ivanka is listed as an adviser and her husband is listed as a senior adviser to the president. The Trump campaign responded and said Biden is right about one point: ‚ÄúHunter Biden would never have an office in the White House because he‚Äôs proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden.‚Äù
Video Tulsi Gabbard says she won&apos;t seek re-election to Congress in 2020
Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, announced early Friday, Eastern time, that she will not seek re-election to Congress in 2020 so that she can focus on her bid for the White House. ‚ÄúI will not be seeking re-election to Congress in 2020, and humbly ask you for your support for my candidacy for president of the United States,‚Äù Gabbard said in a video posted online. The decision to not seek a fifth term representing Hawaii‚Äôs 2nd Congressional District makes way for a competitive race for her seat, Hawaii News Now reported.
Gabbard launched her presidential campaign in January. She has been in a war of words with Hillary Clinton after the former secretary of state suggested in an interview last week that Russians were ""grooming‚Äù Gabbard to be a third-party candidate in the 2020 presidential election.
Nude photos prompt freshman Democrat&apos;s lawyers to send &apos;cease and desist&apos; letter to DailyMail
Attorneys representing Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., on Thursday sent a ""cease and desist"" letter to the DailyMail, demanding the British tabloid remove from its website nude photos that it claims depict the freshman congresswoman, and that Hill claims were published without her consent, according to reports. Lawyers Marc Elias and Rachel Jacobs of the firm Perkins Coie wrote to DailyMail executive editor Candace Trunzo on behalf of Hill, threatening swift legal action if the photos ‚Äî one of which purportedly shows Hill naked with a bong ‚Äî were not immediately taken down.
Video DailyMail published a series of nude photos Thursday, which the newspaper claimed showed Hill and a female former campaign staffer. The story comes after website RedState.com reported last week that Hill, who is openly bisexual, had developed a ""long-term sexual relationship"" with the unnamed staffer, who ultimately entered into a ""throuple"" with Hill and her husband, Kenny Heslep -- who has since filed for divorce.

80,billionaire,Historically black college ripped for confining students in dorms so Trump could hold a rally,"President Donald Trump has faced criticism over an event he was to hold on criminal justice reform at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, a historically black school, just after referring to his impeachment as a ‚Äúlynching.‚Äù
On Saturday‚Äôs edition of MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAM Joy,‚Äù economist and author Julianne Malveaux pulled no punches while blasting him for using the institution as a ‚Äúprop‚Äù to excuse his own racism. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúTalk to us for a moment about the significance of how he has used race in this country and why he is now being honored at this university,‚Äù said anchor Ayman Mohyeldin.
‚ÄúWell, first of all, the university did not honor him,‚Äù said Malveaux. ‚ÄúThis organization honored him, whatever they are ‚Äî the Second Step Organization, that‚Äôs looking at criminal justice. So, the university itself did not honor him. So that‚Äôs really important to note. The other thing that‚Äôs important to note is that students were sequestered in their dormitories. It‚Äôs so outrageous. So, you had seven students attend. Only ten were invited. But the rest of the student body could not leave the dormitory. They were sitting in the dormitory, even through the lunch hour, and they gave them snacks as opposed to a lunch. If I were a parent, I would be suing.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow, I will say that, having been a college president myself, college presidents always stuck between a rock and a hard place,‚Äù continued Malveaux. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd be hard to say, no, the president of the United States cannot come to my campus, but the campus did not invite him. This organization invited him. They first leased the college or said, can we have this presidential thing on criminal justice on your campus, and later, after the fact, they brought 45 on. He has used black people consistently as props. He has used HBCUs as props. Remember two years ago, when he had about 70 presidents in the Oval Office. It was a horrible picture. And some of my friends were there, but they said, how do you say no?‚Äù
‚ÄúUnderstand, this South Carolina meeting at Benedict, they flew black Republicans from all over the country so that they had a full house, but they didn‚Äôt have students there,‚Äù said Malveaux.‚ÄúSo, basically, Benedict College allowed itself to be used as a backdrop, but that‚Äôs just like the folks who show up ‚Äî you know, this was a college-based Trump rally. Really, he‚Äôs had a rally on campus and he used the campus.‚Äù ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúHe always talks about low black unemployment rates, but the fact is that the black unemployment rate is twice that of whites, so he‚Äôs normalizing inequality,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs constantly talked about what he has done, but there was a piece of legislation that provided permanent extension of HBCU funds, it got through the House and he did not use his influence to get it through the Senate, so it died. So, he basically just tells lies, big lies, and big, big lies.‚Äù

81,billionaire,"Billionaire Trump-loving governor took $125,000 in bailouts meant for struggling farmers: report","Tweet
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) received $125,000 in emergency stabilization payments for his farms, as part of the bailout program authorized by President Donald Trump to help farmers avoid losses due to the trade war with China.
Justice, a Trump-loving business magnate who briefly switched to the Democratic Party to run for governor of West Virginia and switched back to the GOP after the election, hardly fits the profile of a struggling farmer. He is worth $1.5 billion , and owns over 50 businesses, including a network of coal mines and the Greenbriar luxury resort, a popular gathering place for Republican officials. ADVERTISEMENT
But Justice is far from the only rich businessman to profit from the farm bailouts. A recent report from the Environmental Working Group revealed that of the $16 billion appropriated by the Department of Agriculture, 54 percent went to just the top one-tenth of farms, with 82 farmers receiving over $500,000 and several recipients actually living in large cities. The bottom 80 percent of farmers received less than $5,000 each, and farmers of color received almost nothing.
Justice is not even the only politician to benefit from the program. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), also a firm supporter of Trump, has applied for the bailouts multiple times.
West Virginia is one of Trump‚Äôs strongest states, with Morning Consult showing net approval of 20 points . Justice, on the other hand, ranks among the least popular governors in the country, at 5 points underwater . He faces a strong Democratic challenger in state Sen. Ron Stollings, as well as a primary challenge from his own former Secretary of Commerce Woody Thrasher. ADVERTISEMENT Enjoy this piece?

82,billionaire,Billionaire Jon Stryker Donates $2 Million To Spelman College To Create First Ever Queer Studies Chair At An HBCU,"Spelman College today announced a matching gift of up to $2 million from billionaire philanthropist Jon Stryker to create a chair in queer studies, the first position of its kind at a historically black college or university (HBCU). The chair will be named after the black lesbian poet and activist Audre Lorde. Stryker is the founder and president of the Arcus Foundation, which supports LGBTQ rights and the protection of the great apes. His estimated $3.9 billion fortune stems from Stryker Corp., the medical equipment firm his grandfather founded in 1941. He says he donated, in part, because the advancement of LGBTQ rights depends on education.
‚ÄúThe more that people understand queer history and LGBTQ issues, the more likely they are to accept and support the LGBTQ community,‚Äù Stryker told Forbes in an email. ‚ÄúBy empowering and educating the next generation, we can help make a future where LGBTQ people have full and equal protections under the law.‚Äù
The chair will teach classes in queer studies‚Äîallowing students at the all-female Atlanta college to concentrate in the subject as part of its comparative women‚Äôs studies major‚Äîand direct community-wide conversations and advocacy around queer issues. Beverly Guy-Sheftall, founding director of Spelman‚Äôs Women‚Äôs Research and Resource Center, says Spelman would be the only HBCU in the country with a queer studies program.
Guy-Sheftall says a host of factors has stymied efforts to introduce queer studies programs to HBCUs in the past, including religious affiliations, a dearth of faculty with expertise and occasional alumni resistance. She says she faced similar challenges when she worked to establish the women‚Äôs studies major at Spelman in the 1980s.
‚ÄúThere was some angst about how serious or rigorous or faddish it was, or was it going to disappear?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThere was a lot of anxiety‚Äîwhat can students do with women‚Äôs studies and queer studies? They do the same thing [as they can] with a history, English or philosophy major.‚Äù
The position will build on other initiatives at Spelman related to gender and sexuality. In September 2018, the college received a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish an Institute for the Study of Gender and Sexuality. And in 2017, Spelman announced it would admit female-identifying students regardless of their gender assignment at birth and would allow a student who transitions to a man while at Spelman to complete their studies. Those moves have placed Spelman among a growing number of women‚Äôs colleges redefining their admissions policies to include transgender students. Guy-Sheftall says this environment, in addition to student activism and conversations with the larger community, prompted the Women‚Äôs Research and Resource Center to seek funding for a queer studies faculty position.
‚ÄúWe were getting more students who were already out and queer, and even parents of those students asking the question, ‚ÄòIs this a place where my daughter or son can thrive?‚Äô‚Äù Guy-Sheftall says. ‚ÄúParents, the general political climate and activism among queer students on our campus pushed colleges and universities to respond to students who were willing to be out.‚Äù
Guy-Sheftall says the connection between Spelman, Audre Lorde and Stryker‚Äôs Arcus Foundation is a natural one. The poet donated her personal papers and articles to the college in her will, and the foundation provided a grant to make the papers publicly accessible in 2009. Lorde‚Äôs relationship with Spelman dates back to her friendship with the college‚Äôs first black female president, Johnnetta Cole. Lorde‚Äôs son Jonathan Rollins says his mother would have been ‚Äúover the moon‚Äù about the chaired position at Spelman named in her honor.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very significant because Audre discussed her identity as a black lesbian feminist warrior poet‚Äîand no element of that was any more or less important than any other element of it,‚Äù he says.
Queer studies is a relatively new discipline but has come a long way since Yale University rejected playwright Larry Kramer‚Äôs offer to donate millions to endow a professorship in gay studies in 1997. There are more than two dozen higher education institutions that offer at least classes related to LGBT issues, according the College Equality Index .
As a matching gift, Stryker‚Äôs $2 million is contingent on Spelman‚Äôs fundraising efforts. Guy-Sheftall says it will take about two years to raise the sum, meaning the chair can hopefully be hired by 2022.
Stryker says he intentionally chose to structure the grant on a matching basis. ‚ÄúI firmly believe that there should be a community aspect to giving like this,‚Äù he told Forbes . ‚ÄúBy making this gift a matching donation, it ensures that the Spelman College community and network of alumnae and donors have a stake and ownership in the Queer Studies chair.‚Äù
Stryker‚Äôs sister, Ronda‚Äîwho sits on Spelman‚Äôs board of trustees‚Äî made the largest gift by a living donor in the college‚Äôs history when she and her husband gave $30 million to build Spelman‚Äôs Center for Innovation & the Arts in 2018.

83,billionaire,A billionaire who signed the Giving Pledge in 2012 said Bill Gates' philanthropy pact isn't 'growing as rapidly as we hoped',"Tow built his fortune after founding telecommunications provider Century Communications, according to the Carnegie Corporation. Filip Wolak/Carnegie Corporation Telecommunications billionaire Leonard Tow isn't satisfied with how his fellow billionaires have responded to the Giving Pledge 's challenge to give away the majority of their fortunes. Founded by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010, the pledge has 204 signatories including Marc Benioff , MacKenzie Bezos , and Mark Zuckerberg ‚Äî and it could be worth up to $600 billion by 2022, research firm Wealth-X found. Tow's remarks come as the ultra-wealthy face heightened criticism over their philanthropic works ‚Äî or lack thereof. Tow built his fortune after founding telecommunications provider Century Communications, according to the Carnegie Corporation. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
One member of Bill Gates ' and Warren Buffett 's Giving Pledge isn't satisfied with how his fellow billionaires have responded to the challenge to give away the majority of their fortunes.
""Bill Gates and Warren Buffett organized a kind of institution that is growing steadily, and perhaps not as rapidly as we hoped, but rapidly in the eyes of many,"" telecommunications billionaire Leonard Tow said of the Giving Pledge while accepting an award for his own giving at the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy award ceremony in New York City on October 16.
Tow's remarks come as the ultra-wealthy face heightened criticism over their philanthropic works ‚Äî or lack thereof. Dan Riffle, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's policy adviser and the author of the slogan ""every billionaire is a policy failure,"" said in July that while big philanthropy can be a good thing, high-income taxes on the 1% would allow their resources to be distributed more democratically.
A representative for the Giving Pledge declined to comment to Business Insider on the growth of the Giving Pledge. The Giving Pledge could be worth $600 million by 2022
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge in 2010 to encourage billionaires to give away the majority of their fortunes, according to the organization's website . The pledge now has 204 signatories from 23 different countries, including Marc Benioff, MacKenzie Bezos, Sara Blakely, Richard Branson, Micheal Bloomberg, and Ray Dalio. The pledge could be worth up to $600 billion by 2022, research firm Wealth-X found.
Those impressive stats aside, the pledge has come under criticism in the past for not verifying that signatories actually donate the money they pledge and for not accepting applications to become a signatory from the public. The late hedge fund manager Robert Wilson called the pledge ""practically worthless"" in an email exchange published by Buzzfeed News in 2014 because it allows donors to name their own foundations in their wills, Business Insider previously reported.
""These foundations become, more often than not, bureaucracy-ridden sluggards,"" Wilson wrote. ""These rich are delighted to toss off a few million a year in order to remain socially acceptable. But that's it."" While Wilson was offered the opportunity to sign the pledge by Gates, he declined.
Tow and his now-deceased wife Claire signed the Giving Pledge in September 2012 and, in an open letter to Gates at the time, wrote that they ""never believed that the wealth accumulated was truly ours."" At the October 2019 ceremony, Tow said that he plans to give away all of his fortune with the exception of ""modest provisions"" for family members.
Tow built his fortune after founding telecommunications provider Century Communications, according to the Carnegie Corporation.

84,billionaire,George Soros says Wall Street won't determine 2020 election - Business Insider,"Two crossed lines that form an 'X'. It indicates a way to close an interaction, or dismiss a notification. Getty Images / Andia / Contributor George Soros told The New York Times in an interview published Friday that he doesn't think Wall Street will decide the next president. He also said that Elizabeth Warren is the candidate to beat, according to the report, and that he supports her policy to tax the wealthy. Still, Wall Street has balked at Warren's tax policies, and some have said they won't support her. Read more on Business Insider .
George Soros , the billionaire philanthropist and former investor, doesn't think that Wall Street will determine the next president of the US in 2020.
""There are more Main Streets in America than there are Wall Streets,"" Soros said in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin that The New York Times published Friday . ""So I don't think that Wall Street, other than being a source of money, will have its way in choosing the president.""
He's predicting that much will turn around in 2020, as he sees signs that people are growing tired of nationalistic tendencies, according to the report. While he hasn't endorsed a candidate, Soros told the Times that Elizabeth Warren has ""emerged as the clear-cut person to beat.""
He continued: ""I don't take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.""
Soros said he disagrees with Wall Street's gripes about Warren's policies that would tax the rich and impose tighter regulations on banks . Soros has long supported taxing the wealthy, and in June was one of many wealthy individuals who signed a letter supporting Warren's wealth tax.
He doesn't think that such taxes are a threat to capitalism, according to the Times.
Still, Wall Street has been largely divided on Warren because of her policies. Some analysts have argued that a Warren presidency would weigh on stocks in financial, healthcare, and energy sectors .
In addition, Democratic donors on Wall Street have warned that they'll back Trump instead of Warren if she wins the party's nomination, according to CNBC .
Soros himself is a prominent champion of liberal causes and has given millions of dollars to PACs that have supported Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton and opposed President Trump. In July, he launched Democracy PAC with $5.1 million to fund 2020 election spending, at the time the biggest check from any megadonor for 2020, according to Politico .",2019-10-25T03:00:00.000+03:00,businessinsider.com,crossed|*|line|*|form|*|x|*|-pron-|*|indicate|*|way|*|close|*|interaction|*|dismiss|*|notification|*|getty_images|*|andia|*|contributor|*|george_soros|*|tell|*|new_york|*|times|*|interview|*|publish|*|friday|*|-pron-|*|think|*|wall_street|*|decide|*|president|*|-pron-|*|elizabeth_warren|*|candidate|*|beat|*|accord|*|report|*|-pron-|*|support|*|-pron-|*|policy|*|tax|*|wealthy|*|wall_street|*|balk|*|warren|*|tax|*|policy|*|-pron-|*|support|*|-pron-|*|read|*|business_insider|*|george_soros|*|billionaire|*|philanthropist|*|investor|*|think|*|wall_street|*|determine|*|president|*|main|*|street|*|america|*|wall|*|streets|*|soros|*|interview|*|andrew|*|ross|*|sorkin|*|new_york|*|times|*|publish|*|friday|*|-pron-|*|think|*|wall_street|*|source|*|money|*|-pron-|*|way|*|choose|*|president|*|-pron-|*|predict|*|turn|*|-pron-|*|sign|*|people|*|grow|*|tired|*|nationalistic|*|tendency|*|accord|*|report|*|-pron-|*|endorse|*|candidate|*|soros|*|tell|*|times|*|elizabeth_warren|*|emerge|*|clear|*|cut|*|person|*|beat|*|-pron-|*|continue|*|-pron-|*|public|*|stance|*|-pron-|*|believe|*|-pron-|*|qualified|*|president|*|soros|*|-pron-|*|disagree|*|wall_street|*|gripe|*|warren|*|policy|*|tax|*|rich|*|impose|*|tight|*|regulation|*|bank|*|soros|*|long|*|support|*|tax|*|wealthy|*|june|*|wealthy|*|individual|*|sign|*|letter|*|support|*|warren|*|wealth_tax|*|-pron-|*|think|*|taxis|*|threat|*|capitalism|*|accord|*|times|*|wall_street|*|largely|*|divide|*|warren|*|-pron-|*|policy|*|analyst|*|argue|*|warren|*|presidency|*|weigh|*|stock|*|financial|*|healthcare|*|energy|*|sector|*|addition|*|democratic|*|donor|*|wall_street|*|warn|*|-pron-|*|trump|*|instead|*|warren|*|-pron-|*|win|*|party|*|nomination|*|accord|*|cnbc|*|soros|*|-pron-|*|prominent|*|champion|*|liberal|*|cause|*|million_of_dollar|*|pac|*|support|*|democratic_candidate|*|hillary_clinton|*|oppose|*|president_trump|*|july|*|-pron-|*|launch|*|democracy|*|pac|*|million|*|fund|*|election|*|spending|*|time|*|big|*|check|*|megadonor|*|accord|*|politico
85,billionaire,BoA saving billions on the cloud; the Kabbalah connection,"Hi, folks.
Friendly neighborhood hedge-fund reporter Bradley Saacks here pinch-hitting for Olivia and Meredith.
We here at Business Insider, like many other organizations, spend a lot of time thinking, reporting, and writing about who&apos;s next ‚Äî the next CEO of a major bank, the next big unicorn founder, the next hedge-fund billionaire.
Last week, we rolled out our annual list of people rapidly shifting from ""next"" to ""now"" with our rising stars of Wall Street list , and the fun didn&apos;t stop there. This week, we told who&apos;s next at Apollo&apos;s $77 billion private-equity business.
As my colleague Casey Sullivan wrote, the two Apollo veterans tasked with putting that massive pool of money to work are David Sambur and Matt Nord, a 39-year-old and a 40-year-old, respectively, who were described as some of the most ""Apolloesque"" dealmakers within the firm in Casey&apos;s story. Still, while they may be trained in Leon Black&apos;s contrarian style and have no plans to change how the firm invests, the duo told us they may need to be more transparent in communicating the firm&apos;s PE deals and investment strategy .
Political pressure, primarily from progressive presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have painted PE as an industry that is ""sucking the value out of our companies,"" as Warren recently tweeted.
Warren has said that PE firms take over companies, load them with debt, strip assets, and then walk away ‚Äî rich from huge management fees ‚Äî when they go bankrupt. She has proposed legislation that would bring a 100% tax on fees earned by private-equity firms and create laws to protect workers&apos; financial interests in the event of bankruptcies.
As we barrel toward the Democratic primaries and the 2020 election, further demonization of Wall Street is to be expected. The big question I have: Will any of these negative headlines around private-equity takeovers leading to massive job cuts actually change the way that deals get done? If a Democrat is elected and makes life so difficult for some of these firms, is there going to be a tipping point where the entire model needs to change?
As always, below is a selection of stories from around the newsroom that we have curated especially for you, the dedicated reader and supporter of Business Insider Prime. Please send newsletter-related compliments, tips, and complaints to me this week at bsaacks@businessinsider.com . And thanks for reading!

Bank of America&apos;s CEO says that it&apos;s saved $2 billion a year by ignoring Amazon or Microsoft and building its own cloud instead
Bank of America has bucked the Wall Street trend by building its own private cloud software rather than outsourcing to companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google .
The investment, including a $350 million charge in 2017, hasn&apos;t been cheap, but it has had a striking payoff, CEO Brian Moynihan said during the company&apos;s third-quarter earnings call.
He said the decision helped reduce the firm&apos;s servers to 70,000 from 200,000 and its data centers to 23 from 60, and it has resulted in $2 billion in annual infrastructure savings.

Merrill Lynch is shifting how it handles staff who drop out of its financial adviser trainee program, and it highlights the industry&apos;s evolving career paths
Financial advisers-in-training at Bank of America&apos;s wealth-management arm who exit the trainee program without becoming full-fledged advisers are more commonly transitioning to different roles within the firm instead of leaving altogether, according to Andy Sieg, the head of Merrill Lynch.
That shift underscores financial advisers&apos; evolving career paths. Some recruiters and experts describe an increasingly difficult environment for wealth advisers across the industry as the business of wealth management has become more competitive and crowded with countless digital, self-directed options.
Firms may be more ""open to the idea of possibly finding something that would be a better fit"" than they were in the past, one wealth-management recruiter told us.
As Business Insider first reported, Merrill Lynch hiked trainee financial advisers&apos; starting salaries by $10,000 earlier this year as it looks to attract new talent.

Goldman Sachs unloaded some of its WeWork shares before its investment bankers pitched investors on what it once considered a $60 billion IPO
Goldman Sachs sold some of its stake in WeWork even as the investment bank was pitching the coworking company for a highly lucrative IPO mandate.
The bank unloaded shares at two earlier fundraising rounds when the WeWork mega-investor SoftBank gave employees and earlier investors a chance to sell their stake, according to a person with knowledge of Goldman&apos;s actions.
WeWork set the price of those sales. The bank assigned a ""much more modest"" valuation to the company than the $47 billion value set earlier this year, or the $61 billion to $96 billion range the firm&apos;s investment bankers told the company&apos;s top execs it might get in an IPO.

Elite law firm Irell & Manella ‚Äî where partners make more than $3 million a year ‚Äî is seeing turbulence and departures after merger talks with a rival firm fell apart
Irell & Manella, an elite California law firm that&apos;s arguing a case before the US Supreme Court, has experienced an exodus of partners after entering and exiting merger discussions in recent months, Business Insider has learned.
Since August, Irell has seen the departures of its managing partner as well as the heads of its global investigations and restructuring practices.
The situation marks a tumultuous period for one of the US&apos;s most prestigious litigation firms, where lawyers are known for charging as much as $1,750 an hour. Its swashbuckling leader, Morgan Chu, is considered one of the most prolific trial lawyers, and firm clients include United Talent Agency, Warner Brothers, and Uber.
The revelations help explain how the firm, where partners earn more than $3 million a year, on average, is squinting to see a clear picture of its future.

The Kabbalah connection: Insiders say a celebrity-centered religious sect deeply influenced how Adam Neumann ran WeWork before its spectacular collapse
As Adam and Rebekah Neumann built WeWork into a $47 billion coworking giant, the couple relied on the teachings of the Kabbalah Centre, a spiritual organization whose high-pressure donation tactics have drained multiple former members&apos; bank accounts , sources told Business Insider.
Kabbalah Centre Rabbi Eitan Yardeni was a regular sight at WeWork offices, where former employees said he helped put together at least one deal, met with company executives, and, in at least one instance, spoke with the entire company as a ""spiritual counselor.""
In conversations with Business Insider, former Kabbalah Centre members said Yardeni pressured them into making large donations to the religious sect, telling them that their spiritual health depended on it.

87,billionaire,"ALERT: Antifa puppetmasters to engineer ""patriot"" slaughter of Leftists to spark violent uprising against conservatives","ALERT: Antifa puppetmasters to engineer ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù slaughter of Leftists to spark violent uprising against conservatives
Sunday, October 20, 2019 by: Mike Adams Tags: antifa , civil war , Collapse , crash , deep state , false-flag , globalists , President Trump , terrorism , treason , uprising , violence , White House
( Natural News ) Antifa is ‚Äúmobbing up‚Äù for an engineered chaos event, according to multiple eyewitness accounts of Antifa activities at public events such as Trump rallies. This coincides with accelerated mainstream media calls for Trump to be removed from power or arrested, along with an explosion in pop culture messaging that calls for Trump to be hogtied, tortured and / or executed. The coordinated messaging and accelerating George Soros funding of mob-for-hire Antifa terrorists points to an imminent event that will unleash nationwide political, civil and financial chaos from which globalists hope to remove Trump from power (or collapse the United States if Trump survives).
This analysis is derived from multiple personal interviews, eyewitness accounts, media sources (cited below) and informed familiarity with the history of the communist playbook from which these events are unfolding. Highlights of this analysis: A sudden increase in the number of paid Antifa terrorists is now being observed in multiple cities across the United States. The increased recruitment of Antifa mobs coincides with a coordinated media campaign to incite mass violence against Trump supporters and the President himself. Deep state operatives such as James Clapper and John Brennan ‚Äî who masterminded the criminal plot to undermine democracy and overrule the 2016 election ‚Äî are now ‚Äúlawyering up‚Äù as Bill Barr‚Äôs DOJ actions rapidly approach. This speaks to the desperation and urgency of the deep state to initiate mass chaos within weeks. To achieve their goals of a political coup, the unhinged, lawless Left needs a ‚Äúspark‚Äù event to pull the trigger and flip Antifa masses into an enraged, violent mob that will unleash bloodshed on the streets of America. That ‚Äúspark‚Äù event is likely to consist of a massive staged (theatrical) false flag event where high-level Antifa operatives dress up as patriot Trump supporters and slaughter a large number of Antifa protesters. (Charlottesville 2.0) CNN, as usual, will be tipped off to the upcoming false flag shooting to make sure CNN‚Äôs cameras capture the event and all its blood and gore. Trump will be blamed for the mass death, and the event will be exploited by the treasonous fake news media to simultaneously demand the arrest or removal of Trump and the immediate nullification of the United States Constitution and its Second Amendment. As this is taking place, globalist financial operators will wage a sell-off war of U.S. currency and U.S. debt in a desperate effort to crash the U.S. banking system, sacrificing New York banks as unavoidable casualties in the war to eliminate Trump and maintain globalist control over not just the United States, but all countries now facing a populist uprising.

Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link .
Full details below‚Ä¶ President Trump and the DOJ are about to make history by exposing the criminal cartel that has ruled America for decades
To understand the urgency of the effort to remove Trump from power, we must keep in mind that the U.S. government has been, for decades, run by a criminal cartel of intelligence operatives, anti-American globalists and money-laundering grifters. The purpose of government, in the minds of these treasonous actors, boils down to two things: 1) control , and 2) profit . The bigger the government, the more money that people like Joe Biden, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and others can skim off government revenues. If you thought Joe Biden‚Äôs shakedown of Ukraine to the tune of over a billion dollars funneled to his son was an aberrant event, think again: They all do it, Republicans and Democrats alike.
But not Trump.
Donald J. Trump made his own fortune, independent from government, and he doesn‚Äôt view government power as a way to collect a massive personal fortune by selling government influence (i.e. the Clinton Foundation) or threatening foreign nations to dish out large revenue streams to his family members. What Joe Biden did in Ukraine has been repeated countless times by the Clintons (where did all the Haiti relief funds go?) and nearly every other connected politician. Big government is a big scam for the political elite , and the more taxes they can raise from the public to fund various government projects, the more these corrupt elitists can skim money from incoming Treasury revenues by setting up family foundations, ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù groups and other shell vehicles for receiving bribes, kickbacks and shakedown cash.
Trump‚Äôs unwillingness to play along with this grand scam has made him enemy No. 1. It‚Äôs not just about the politics here‚Ä¶ to the Democrats, it‚Äôs about protecting their personal profits . How did Sen. Feinstein become worth hundreds of millions of dollars while ‚Äúserving‚Äù as a California senator? It‚Äôs simple: She turned her office into a spy hub to feed U.S. secrets and the identities of anti-communist activists directly to Beijing. Feinstein is a traitor, but serving as a traitor in a corrupt system of big government pays off handsomely to those willing to sell out their own country (which now includes the NBA, NFL and ESPN, by the way, on the culture side of things).
It‚Äôs no surprise, then, when Nancy Pelosi calls for a communist-style revolution against President Trump . She‚Äôs protecting her own corrupt skimming operations and money laundering scams. Eliminating Trump and overthrowing the rule of law is the only way corrupt traitors like Pelosi can remain in power and continue to dupe the American people.
That‚Äôs why deranged congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is now openly discussing which prisons would be used for imprisoning Trump and his Cabinet officials . It‚Äôs also why Rep. Adam Schiff‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù has now evaporated into obscurity‚Ä¶ because Schiff fabricated the existence of the whistleblower in the first place . It was all rigged from the start as another deep state false flag operation against President Trump. Mobbing up the left-wing troops in preparation for massive civil unrest following the planned false flag shooting of Antifa members
The true puppetmasters in all this are, of course, George Soros and Barack Obama, who was a seditious traitor and ‚Äúsleeper cell‚Äù against America from the very beginning. As InfoWars.com now reports , Antifa has announced a plan to overthrow President Trump by invoking violent, nationwide revolution:
The anti-American organization Antifa announced their plan to overthrow President Trump through violent revolution, and the Trump administration finally responded by activating the Marines to prevent a Deep State coup. The violent far-left group is funded in part by billionaire George Soros and Clinton/Obama stay-behind networks such as MoveOn and Onward Together. Universities and the mainstream media readily amplify Antifa‚Äôs seditious anti-Trump agenda and frequently provide cover for the group‚Äôs violence toward conservatives.
AllNewsPipeline.com, which has emerged as one of the most important new voices in pro-liberty independent media, adds this crucial analysis :
Story: ‚ÄúThe Blueprint For Democrats To Complete Their Overthrow Of America Is Already Written As Retired Admiral Calls For President Trump To Be ‚ÄòRemoved‚Äô From Office, ‚ÄòThe Sooner, The Better'‚Äù
With Retired Admiral William McRaven, a Hillary Clinton fan, publishing an op-ed in Friday‚Äôs New York Times titled ‚ÄúOur Republic Is Under Attack From the President‚Äù within which he argued that President Trump must be removed from office and ‚Äúthe sooner the better‚Äù hinting that things could turn terribly ugly in the days and weeks ahead, as Breitbart reports in this story, McRaven‚Äôs op-ed gives a military imprimatur to what President Donald Trump has already likened to a ‚Äúcoup.‚Äù
As InfoWars, Natural News, AllNewsPipeline and many others have reported, the United States President has the authority to invoke the 1907 Insurrection Act to deal with traitors and acts of sedition.
On October 6 of this year, NewsTarget, our political and current events site, first reported the Pentagon ordering reserve U.S. Marines units to active status in anticipation of an ‚Äúemergency within the United States‚Äù which ‚Äúwill come with little warning.‚Äù That same order also cited ‚Äúthreats in the Homeland.‚Äù As that story reported:
[A] directive involving the United States Marine Corps reserve units via MARADMINS number 550/19, signed on Oct. 3, 2019, authorized by Brigadier General Daniel L. Shipley, Director, Manpower Plans and Policy. This new order is summarized as, ‚ÄúMARINES ORDERED TO ACTIVE DUTY ISO DEFENSE SUPPORT OF CIVIL AUTHORITIES.‚Äù
The following newspaper ad, published by the New York Times, typifies the level of hysteria and lawlessness now being parroted by the indoctrinated Left. It also proves how the New York Times is complicit in pushing an illegal, violent coup attempt against Trump and the tens of million of supporters who voted him into office:
All this, of course, is being bankrolled by George Soros. As InfoWars reports :
Soros has activated Antifa for civil unrest during key historical events, such as in 2018 amid Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and in Baltimore 2015 during the Freddie Gray protests. The Deep State and their cohorts have been intensifying their coup against Trump in light of Democrats losing grip of their hoaxes against him ahead of 2020. It‚Äôs clear the establishment plans use Antifa as an ignition point to kick off a larger civil war to overthrow Trump before the 2020 election.
It‚Äôs not just America, by the way. The globalists want authoritarian control over all people across all nations. As TheMostImportantNews.com reports :
All over the globe, the mood is turning sour. Anger and frustration are bubbling over, and protests are becoming violent in major cities all across the planet. In some cases economic pain is driving the protests and in other cases political matters are motivating the protesters, and it has been a very long time since we have seen so many angry protests happening all over the world simultaneously. Unfortunately, many believe that what we have seen so far is just the beginning. Global economic conditions are rapidly deteriorating, and as economic pain intensifies that is only going to make everyone more frustrated. And here in the United States, the drama surrounding the potential impeachment of Donald Trump is going to greatly escalate the political tensions that are already deeply dividing this country‚Ä¶ and that could very easily lead to tremendous civil unrest.
As TheMostImportantNews.com reports :
All over the globe, the mood is turning sour. Anger and frustration are bubbling over, and protests are becoming violent in major cities all across the planet. In some cases economic pain is driving the protests and in other cases political matters are motivating the protesters, and it has been a very long time since we have seen so many angry protests happening all over the world simultaneously.

And here in the United States, the drama surrounding the potential impeachment of Donald Trump is going to greatly escalate the political tensions that are already deeply dividing this country‚Ä¶ and that could very easily lead to tremendous civil unrest. The ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù of a communist revolution and mass violence
Institutions of pop culture are also using public billboards, Netflix shows, TV shows and movies to indoctrinate mentally weak (i.e. easy to brainwash) left-wing masses into marching toward mass violence. As Fox News recently reported, a billboard in Times Square featured a U.S. Marine hog-tying and torturing President Trump. The ad was entitled, ‚ÄúLady Liberty,‚Äù underscoring how radical left-wing communism and violence is now being branded a form of ‚Äúliberty.‚Äù (This is also how Satanism and atheism is branded, by the way, as ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù from morality and religion.)
Just a few months ago, a Hollywood film called, ‚ÄúThe Hunt,‚Äù featured Trump supporters being hunted and killed for sport . As is often the case, Hollywood fantasizes about violence against conservatives, Christians, gun owners and Trump supporters . Those twisted, violent fantasies are then captured in film scripts that get pushed into mainstream culture. The message from the Left goes something like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to kill conservatives, because their words are a form of violence against the rest of us.‚Äù That‚Äôs the twisted logic now being pushed everywhere, including across many of America‚Äôs universities.
Here‚Äôs a screen shot from ‚ÄúThe Hunt‚Äù:
And then there‚Äôs Kathy Griffin, whose depictions of extreme violence against a sitting U.S. President have made her a hero among deranged Leftists. When Griffin held up a bloodied, decapitated (mock) head of President Trump, she was virtue signaling to the entire country that, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to murder Trump, because orange man bad.‚Äù
Finally, don‚Äôt forget Antifa‚Äôs ‚ÄúBorder Resistance Tour‚Äù posted which depicts the burning of the American flag, mass violence in the streets, civil unrest, the burning of vehicles, dead patriots shot by arrows, a security tower being burned to the ground with arson, illegal aliens bursting through a border wall fence, Molotov cocktails being thrown at border patrol infrastructure, and much more:
These open depictions of violence against President Trump and his supporters are, of course, widely accepted by Democrat politicians, the left-wing media and left-wing activists, none of whom ever seem to denounce such depictions of violence against Trump . Yet if similar depictions had been made against President Obama during his two terms, the left-wing media would have exploded with accusations of ‚Äúextremism‚Äù and ‚Äúdomestic terrorism.‚Äù
As usual, when the Left calls for violence, there is no outcry. If anything, there‚Äôs a piling on as more anti-Trump fervor is whipped up by the anti-Trump media such as CNN, now exposed by Project Veritas as Jeff Zucker‚Äôs personal propaganda attack rag that has but one purpose: To eliminate Trump from power (and maybe just kill him in the process). Jussie Smollett times a thousand
All this points to globalists and puppetmasters indoctrinating the public with mass hatred and anger in preparation for an engineered event. This event must be so gruesome, so violent and so emotionally charged that it will cause Leftists to spontaneously combust into mass violence against conservatives and Trump supporters.
In effect, globalists are planning a left-wing 9/11-scale event that will set off Leftists and provide CNN and the fake news media a narrative of blame against Trump and his supporters.
Think Jussie Smollett times a thousand . With Leftists and globalists, it‚Äôs always about staging mass killings to blame their political opponents.
Charlottesville 2.0.
Here‚Äôs what an analysis of all this concludes is coming: The staging of a ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù slaughter of Antifa protesters
After careful analysis of all the possible false flag events, we‚Äôve concluded that the event with the most emotional energy which would unleash mass left-wing violence against Trump supporters and conservatives would be a staged ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù mass slaughter of Antifa protesters .
The ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù doing the shooting, of course, will all be actors augmented by the same deep state shooters who are routinely run by the FBI to carry out mass shootings like the El Paso Wal-Mart event, which was all about bringing gun control to Texas.
The FBI, as we have exhaustively documented with the help of the New York Times and the Kansas City Star (see below), is the single most prolific terrorism engineering organization in America, and its operatives have taken part in literally thousands of planned terrorism events that have been staged to ensnare homeless people, drug users and others who are targeted by the FBI for staged take downs.
See this important story on FBIcorruption.news : ‚ÄúBOMBSHELL: Mass shooting events follow pattern of ‚ÄúFBI terror plots‚Äù documented by the New York Times‚Ä¶ agents recruit social media extremists to frame as scapegoats for engineered violence.‚Äù From the story, which cites the NYT and the Kansas City Star:
The mass shooting events that have rocked America over the past two days follow the pattern of ‚ÄúFBI terror plots‚Äù documented by the New York Times and the Kansas City Star (see sources, below) as being created and carried out by FBI agents. These two shootings were initiated in the hours following the bombshell revelation that the FBI conspired with Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration to destroy Clinton‚Äôs email hard drives as a means to eliminate any evidence of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs prosecutable crimes.
Former FBI director James Comey is now known to have run multiple criminal schemes to illegally frame Trump administration officials while clearing Obama-era officials as part of a treasonous deep state plot to overthrow the United States of America, defeat President Trump and frame Trump supporters as domestic terrorists.
It now appears abundantly obvious that the FBI is the most prolific terrorist organization in America, and this fact has been confirmed by the New York Times. Under the treasonous command of Barack Obama and James Comey, the FBI was radicalized and weaponized into a treasonous crime syndicate that routinely plotted and carried out acts of terrorism against the United States of America, all while covering up the damning evidence of criminality and treason that should have sent Hillary Clinton to prison.
Even the New York Times accidentally admitted all this. See the New York Times article, Terrorist Plots, Hatched by the F.B.I.
A would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on his way to the Capitol; a scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot Stinger missiles at military aircraft was developed by men in Newburgh, N.Y.; and a fanciful idea to fly explosive-laden model planes into the Pentagon and the Capitol was hatched in Massachusetts.
But all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I., whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy missile, fake C-4 explosives, a disarmed suicide vest and rudimentary training. Suspects na√Øvely played their parts until they were arrested.
‚ÄúThere has been a clear effort to manufacture plots.‚Äù
In case you have trouble believing that the New York Times reported on the FBI running terror plots, across the United States, here‚Äôs a screen shot of their article, linked above:
It‚Äôs also the Kansas City Star, too. Although they modified their article since we began covering their reporting, it‚Äôs still worth reading:
The Kansas City Star: FBI undercover stings foil terrorist plots ‚Äî but often plots of the agency‚Äôs own making .
‚ÄúWhat I get concerned about is where the plot is being hatched by the FBI,‚Äù said Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and former FBI agent. ‚ÄúThere has been a clear effort to manufacture plots.‚Äù
Of 126 Islamic State-related cases prosecuted by federal authorities across the country since 2014, nearly two-thirds involved undercover agents or informants, according to the Center on National Security at the Fordham University School of Law in New York.
Here‚Äôs my detailed analysis of the FBI‚Äôs terror plots and how the FBI is actively plotting to take down President Trump by conspiring with deep state traitors such as James Comey, Hillary Clinton, John Brennan and Andrew McCabe: How the FBI, CNN, deep state operatives, George Soros and Antifa terrorists will stage a mass slaughter of Antifa‚Äôs own people
Here‚Äôs how all this is likely to be rolled out, step by step:
1) A very large number of Antifa ‚Äúprotesters‚Äù will be summoned to a public event such as a Trump campaign rally.
2) A group of high-level Antifa terrorists and FBI terrorist operatives will dress up in MAGA hats and patriotic-looking garb (American flags, Trump bumper stickers, etc.).
3) They will be extremely well armed with AR-15s, many of which will have been ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù guns manufactured from 80% lowers, likely using either 3D printers or Ghost Gunner machines. Some will also be wearing ballistic vests. (Remember, all the gear is being chosen to be demonized by the media after the slaughter.)
4) CNN cameras will be prepositioned to capture the planned bloodshed from multiple angles in order to maximize the psychological terrorism that will be inflicted upon the American people after the event unfolds.
5) A small number of scapegoats will be recruited by the FBI, and they will be hard-core Trump supporters, readers of InfoWars.com and likely members of the NRA. These individuals will be told that they are joining a secret Trump protection effort that will protect the President from Antifa violence. Alex Jones publicly predicted this exact scenario in a recent InfoWars broadcast, by the way.
6) The FBI will use its deep state intelligence capabilities to augment a pro-Trump back story on social media , tied to the scapegoats. This will be used after the attack to call for more censorship of conservatives online . (Remember, everything is being ‚Äúpackaged‚Äù to blame the correct political opponents and strip away rights from law-abiding Americans who support Trump.)
7) At the event, the scapegoats will be unleashed along with highly trained shooters and deep state operatives to open fire on a group of Antifa supporters. The attack will feature rapid gunfire, many AR-15 rifles, multiple high-capacity magazines (which the rest of us just call ‚Äústandard capacity,‚Äù by the way) and plenty of bloodshed. CNN‚Äôs cameras will capture everything from multiple angles, seemingly by coincidence. Just like the Roger Stone raid.
8) Federal agents will magically manage to shoot and kill only the patriot scapegoats, who of course have been recruited for exactly this purpose. All the real shooters will get away, but the scapegoats will be either killed and left at the scene or captured and then drugged into oblivion so they can never testify (same pattern as the Aurora, Colorado Batman theater shooting, remember? Every heard from that guy? Nope‚Ä¶)
9) Narrative booster item (from the point of view of the Left): A left-wing journalist gets caught in the crossfire (actually taken out by an FBI sniper) so that the Left can claim Trump supporters are trying to ‚Äúmurder journalists.‚Äù
10) With the mass slaughter of Antifa protesters complete, here‚Äôs the narrative the media will roll out: Trump is evil and it‚Äôs all his fault. Antifa protesters are peaceful victims of Trump-inspired violence. All Trump supporters are violent gun nuts who carry out mass murder. All guns are bad, but especially the homemade AR-15 that was found at the scene, which was made from an 80% lower that was milled out with a Ghost Gunner machine. What an amazing coincidence! Civilians should never be allowed to own or purchase ballistic vests, because the ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù shooter was wearing one. All journalists must be protected from Trump and his supporters so that courageous journalists on CNN can continue to ‚Äúresist‚Äù tyranny and the Trump regime. Ammunition is bad, since ammunition was used to carry out the murders. Look for California-style ammo restrictions to go nationwide. MAGA hats are terrorist symbols, and anyone who wears a MAGA hat is a terrorist and should be violently attacked on site, and it‚Äôs okay to do so. The only way to save America from violent Trump supporters is to have a nationwide uprising of ‚Äúpeaceful, tolerant‚Äù Leftists (who will of course proceed to carry out their own mass murder, arson, bombings, looting, etc., all in the name of ‚Äútolerance.‚Äù)
And there you have it. Tomorrow‚Äôs news today, as InfoWars advertises.
It has all the elements the Left wants to explode into mass consciousness: Anti-Trump hatred, gun control, CNN playing the victim, home made gun parts, censorship of conservatives and much more. All wrapped up into a nice, tidy burrito bowl of bulls##t, courtesy of the FBI, CNN and the same deep state that has been running these staged events throughout U.S. history, including the deep state assassination of JFK, MLK and RFG, plus Waco, Oklahoma City, Ruby Ridge and 9/11.
They‚Äôre not even close to being done pulling false flags to get what they want, by the way. As Tulsi Gabbard accurately says, Hillary Clinton and these deep staters now represent the ‚Äúrot‚Äù of the Democrat power establishment, and there‚Äôs no one they won‚Äôt kill to continue their lust for power and criminal profit schemes that siphon public money into their own corrupt pockets.
There‚Äôs a slaughter coming. When it happens, it will be 100% staged . Hence the need for Big Tech to censor all conservatives before ‚Äúthe big one‚Äù is unleashed. They must control the narrative and silence all dissenting views or independent analysis. Where to find the truth when it all comes down
Now, more than ever, you need to know the websites where you‚Äôll find independent, accurate news analysis, videos and free speech. Some of those sites are:
VIDEO SITES: Brighteon.com and Banned.video are both independently-run video platforms where the truth about false flag operations is routinely exposed. You can post your own videos on Brighteon.com right now. Lisa Haven‚Äôs channel is especially popular there.
NEWS aggregation sites: Read Censored.news , SteveQuayle.com or TheLibertyMill.com for news aggregation. (Censored.news now spiders SHTFplan.com, AllNewsPipeline, InfoWars, PJ Media, The Epoch Times and dozens of other sites.)
INDY MEDIA news sites that must be checked daily include TheGatewayPundit.com , InfoWars.com , TheEpochTimes.com , NewsTarget.com , TheCommonSenseShow.com and many more. (Apologies to all, since this is not a comprehensive list.)
Stay informed, and understand these simple, powerful truths: The mainstream media is dead. There is no ‚Äújournalism‚Äù at CNN, the NYT or The Washington Post. They are all, without exception, propaganda rags working running propaganda the CIA. The tech giants are openly engaged in treason to overthrow America and rig the 2020 election. It‚Äôs time for Trump to arrest the CEOs of the biggest tech giants, seize their domain names and shut them down until they agree to stop censoring conservatives. The deep state is desperate, knowing they are about to be exposed by Durham, Barr and the DOJ efforts. There‚Äôs nothing they won‚Äôt try, including the possible use of dirty bombs or ‚Äúarea weapons‚Äù such as biological or chemical weapons. This is all being run by the CIA, which specialized in overthrowing nations and carrying out political coups. Only now, they‚Äôre doing it to America.
As Paul Craig Roberts recently said in a video interview :
There will be a big crash before the election, and people will blame Trump. That‚Äôs about how smart Americans are. Now, there is one constraint for the Fed doing that because the Fed is a tool of the New York banks. If they crash the economy, they are going to crash those New York banks. That‚Äôs the only restraint on the elites. That‚Äôs their ultimate nuke. If they can‚Äôt get him out, they will say, okay, we are going to bring down the economy and too bad for the New York Banks, or they will find some special way to bail them out while everything else goes: the pension funds, the hedge funds, the mutual funds. They will wipe us out in order to get rid of Trump.
Get ready, folks. This may be the end of America if we don‚Äôt stand up against these FBI terrorists, deep state traitors and globalist puppetmasters.
Never initiate violence, but be ready to stop it .
And never, ever believe a single damn thing reported by the media. They do nothing but lie. Previous : We‚Äôve completed the lab testing: ‚ÄúGroovy Bee‚Äù Collagen Peptides (hydrolyzed collagen) now available through the Health Ranger Store Receive Our Free Email Newsletter

88,billionaire,REVEALED: Speaker Pelosi says she had to stop White House meeting because Trump was too ‚Äòshaken‚Äô by GOP criticism ‚Äì Raw Story,"According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Donald Trump was ‚Äúshaken up‚Äù by the realization that Republicans are criticizing him over his huge mistake in Syria.
‚ÄúIt comes at a very difficult time for him,‚Äù said Pelosi outside the White House meeting. ‚ÄúEarlier today the House of Representatives voted what, 354-60 in opposition to the actions that he has taken in Syria. It calls upon the president to urgently use exercise with restraint and for us to have a humanitarian assistant to some of the Kurdish children being killed there, and reaching support.‚Äù ADVERTISEMENT
Most importantly, however, the bill mandated a clear plan from the president on how to handle ISIS. Just last week, Trump made a unilateral decision to betray the Kurdish people and allow Turkey to bomb them. According to reports, the decision stemmed from Trump‚Äôs desire to get off the phone .
Support from Republicans for the bill was so disarming to the president that it seemed to prompt another presidential meltdown.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably getting to the president because he was shaken up by it,‚Äù Pelosi said. ‚ÄúAnd that is why we continued in the meeting, but he was just not relating to the reality. Again, we are proud of our men and women in uniform. Those who have been in Syria have conducted themselves in a way that makes us very proud.‚Äù
‚ÄúI pray for the president all the time‚Ä¶I pray for the safety and that of his family,‚Äù Pelosi also said. ‚ÄúNow we have to pray for his health‚Äîbecause this was a very serious meltdown.‚Äù ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Enjoy this piece?

89,billionaire,The Trump brothers‚Äô claims that they no longer profit from foreign deals - The Washington Post,"Analysis close Analysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events The Trump brothers‚Äô claims that they no longer profit from foreign deals By November 1, 2019 at 3:00 AM EDT ‚ÄúWhen my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.‚Äù ‚Äî Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, in an interview on Fox News‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ingraham Angle,‚Äù Oct. 15 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been international businesspeople for decades, but we can‚Äôt even do those kinds of deals anymore. We can‚Äôt even continue, and because we chose not to, because we didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate. So that‚Äôs the double standard. The media said, ‚ÄòOh, you‚Äôre enriching yourselves.‚Äô We‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWe literally stopped.‚Äô ‚Äù ‚Äî Donald Trump Jr., executive vice president of the Trump Organization, in an interview on ‚ÄúFox and Friends,‚Äù Oct. 30 AD The president‚Äôs sons say the Trump business empire no longer makes money from foreign deals. It‚Äôs a false claim whether you take Eric Trump‚Äôs version (‚Äúwe got out of all international business‚Äù) or Donald Trump Jr.'s formulation (‚Äúwe literally stopped‚Äù). AD When he took office, Donald Trump resigned from his company and placed his holdings in a trust controlled by Eric, Donald Jr. and Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg. Trump pledged that his businesses would not sign new deals in foreign countries during his presidency and that he would ‚Äúdonate all profits from foreign governments‚Äô patronage of his hotels and similar businesses‚Äù to the U.S. Treasury. AD Yet the Trumps continue to mix government and business in subtle and not-so-subtle ways ‚Äî and they keep expanding and cashing in on their foreign investments. The Facts Trump did not divest from his holdings before taking office, and they‚Äôre significant, including nearly a dozen hotels and about 20 golf courses worldwide. The plaintiffs in three ongoing lawsuits allege that Trump violates the foreign emoluments clause in the Constitution when his businesses receive payments from foreign governments. AD The president files yearly financial disclosure forms with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, showing that he owns more than $130 million in assets in 30 countries and that those assets made more than $100 million in income in 2017 and 2018 combined, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. AD Those totals could be higher because the Office of Government Ethics form asks officials to list their assets and income in ranges, not precise figures. The Trump Organization is privately held and the president has declined to release his tax returns, which are much more detailed than his financial disclosure forms. Still, it‚Äôs enough to dispense with Eric Trump‚Äôs claim that ‚Äúwe got out of all international business.‚Äù The president‚Äôs disclosure forms and the continued existence of Trump properties around the world show it‚Äôs false. AD We can also dispense with Donald Trump Jr.'s claim that the family ‚Äúliterally stopped‚Äù enriching itself from foreign deals. Their assets abroad have generated more than $100 million in income since Trump took office. AD But Trump Jr. often throws in a caveat. In the same ‚ÄúFox and Friends‚Äù interview quoted above, he said: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt even do those kinds of deals anymore. We can‚Äôt even continue.‚Äù In an Oct. 16 interview on Fox News‚Äôs ‚ÄúHannity,‚Äù he said: ‚ÄúWe were international businesspeople before politics and we gave up doing all new deals going forward.‚Äù That‚Äôs what the president pledged. However, Trump‚Äôs sons have been busy selling assets to foreign individuals, expanding or adding onto their existing deals and investments in foreign countries, and collecting payments in U.S. properties from foreign governments. AD Let‚Äôs take a tour. This year, the Trumps sold a 5,400-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion to a company linked to Indonesian billionaire Hary Tanoesoedibjo for $13.5 million. Tanoesoedibjo is the Trumps‚Äô partner on two Indonesian development projects. AD The Trump Organization last month received approval to build 550 houses and a second golf course in Balmedie, a village on the northeastern Scottish coast. ‚ÄúIf the Trump Organization follows through on these plans, it would turn the company into something it has not been before: a large-scale house builder,‚Äù The Washington Post reported . ‚ÄúThe company has built condo buildings before and sold off a few dozen houses or home lots next to other golf courses. But the company is now proposing to build a sizable suburban development, complete with the expenses of roads, streets and a school.‚Äù AD Last month, a local council in southwestern Ireland ‚Äú approved a Trump Organization plan to build 53 houses and a new ballroom at its seaside golf course.‚Äù The Trumps also have pursued existing business in countries such as India and Uruguay, and some experts say it blurs the line between the U.S. government and the Trump Organization‚Äôs finances. AD The Indonesian government is helping to build a new highway that would facilitate access to Trump Residences Lido, a golf course, hotel and 280-home residential community that Tanoesoedibjo is developing with Trump. In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire Council voted to drop a requirement that the Trump Organization make other investments in the Balmedie resort before building the 550 planned homes. (‚ÄúIt is a much, much more lucrative deal now,‚Äù a council member said afterward.) AD The Los Angeles Times reported : The projects can benefit from local zoning or infrastructure improvements, or even when U.S. military crews are billeted there. The House Oversight Committee is investigating why the Pentagon has spent nearly $200,000 at Trump Turnberry golf resort in Scotland since 2017 for overnight stays and other expenses during refueling stops in nearby Glasgow. The Trumps also can market existing projects under the [president‚Äôs self-imposed] guidelines, and actively sell luxury condos to foreign buyers, among other investments. Last month, Trump Jr. hosted about 100 people in New York who had purchased homes in Trump-branded luxury towers near New Delhi. Visitors flew over Manhattan in helicopters, dined at Trump‚Äôs hotel and listened to a ‚Äúfireside chat‚Äù between Trump Jr. and an Indian business partner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the issue of projects. It‚Äôs how influence works,‚Äù said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group among the plaintiffs suing Trump for alleged constitutional violations. ‚ÄúThese towers in India that are going up, they advertised that if you bought before a certain point, you would get to meet Trump Jr. There‚Äôs the project in Indonesia that Don Jr. was just at; they called it a pre-launch ‚Äî a big event attended by members of the government. Their partner, Hary Tano, his daughter was just appointed tourism minister for Indonesia.‚Äù AD ‚ÄúHow does the fact that it benefits the president of the United States‚Äôs bottom line affect those decisions by a foreign government?‚Äù he added. A London-based watchdog group, Global Witness, said in a December 2018 report that the Trumps appeared to be pursuing a new business deal in the Dominican Republic‚Äôs Punta Cana area and that ‚Äúhallmarks of a new deal include, among others, a potential change in Trump‚Äôs role as developer instead of licensor, and the fact that the new and previous projects are not even close to one another ‚Äî they are five miles apart.‚Äù Forbes reported that ‚Äúthe younger Trumps sold a piece of land in January 2018 for $3.2 million‚Äù in the island country. AD We asked whether this constituted a new foreign deal, which would mean Trump broke his pledge. A Trump Organization spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAll of the international projects, including the property in the Dominican Republic which was acquired in 2013, predate the presidency by several years. Some go back more than a decade. Since then, the company has not entered into any new international business deals.‚Äù AD Representatives of foreign governments often stay at or host events in Trump‚Äôs hotel in Washington, near the White House. Lobbyists representing the Saudi government booked 500 nights at Trump International Hotel after his 2016 election. The embassies of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Malaysia and the Philippines all hosted events. (The Trump Organization is weighing a sale of the hotel lease.) Asked about his country‚Äôs independence day celebration at the Trump hotel, the Philippine ambassador was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúHaving it in a hotel that happens to have his name is not necessarily the end-all, be-all. It‚Äôs a statement that we have a good relationship with this president.‚Äù AD The Trump Organization has said it donated $191,000 in profit from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury in 2018 and $150,000 in 2017. But the company has not said how it calculates such profit. Ivanka Trump‚Äôs international fashion line continued to operate for a year and a half after she became a White House adviser. In that role, she deals with foreign leaders and international figures. The same day she and President Trump dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April 2017, China granted her company three preliminary trademarks. The Pinocchio Test Eric Trump claimed, ‚ÄúWhen my father became commander in chief of this country, we got out of all international business.‚Äù That‚Äôs a Four Pinocchio whopper. Donald Trump Jr. at one point claimed the family ‚Äúliterally stopped‚Äù enriching itself from foreign deals. That‚Äôs another Four Pinocchios. For now, we‚Äôll leave unrated Trump Jr.‚Äôs separate claim that the Trump Organization has abstained from new foreign deals. Some of the company‚Äôs recent moves abroad may be seen as new ‚Äúdeals‚Äù or just hugely ambitious extensions, but either way it‚Äôs significant. A multimillion-dollar land sale in the Dominican Republic came in 2018, followed this year with the announcement of a Scottish project that would transform the Trump Organization into a mass builder of more than 500 houses. We also note that the Trump Organization ‚Äî bearing the president‚Äôs name and contributing to his bottom line ‚Äî is unlike any other company hoping for favorable votes in the Aberdeenshire Council or for new roads in Indonesia.

90,billionaire,When two bling billionaires go to war: Arnault and Pinault,"Both are billionaires, both are catnip to celebrities and politicians and both are arch-rivals, locked for two decades in an intractable high-fashion feud set to be reignited. Yes, it's luxury handbags at dawn for French haute couture kingpins Bernard Arnault and Francois-Henri Pinault. READ MORE:‚Ä¢ Bernard Arnault: 'I always liked being number one' The two corporate style giants look likely to go head to head again, as each pursues ownership of iconic American jewellery brand Tiffany's, famed for its delicate turquoise boxes and immortalised by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany's, reports the Daily Mail . Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Habitually unsmiling Arnault ‚Äî known as the ""Pope of fashion"" and a ""wolf in cashmere"", and friends with everyone from Donald Trump to Tony Blair ‚Äî this week proposed an ¬£11.3 billion ($22.7b) take-over of Tiffany's. It sounds a fortune, but Arnault's bid has been described as ""stingy"" ‚Äî and, more significantly, leaves the door open for former playboy Pinault, 57, married to movie star Salma Hayek, to get one over on his old rival yet again. The two fell out in 1999 when they were trying to buy Gucci and have been at loggerheads ever since, each opening museums in Paris so the masses can enjoy their rival art collections, and both making very public donations to the rebuilding of Notre Dame Cathedral. While they have much in common, Arnault, 70, is stealthy ‚Äî he is married to a concert pianist and is a workaholic, spending every possible minute at his desk ‚Äî while Pinault is decidedly showy, courting celebrities by the dozen and even fathering a love child with a supermodel. So who are these twin titans of luxury ‚Äî and who will prevail on this big money battleground? Alison Boshoff adds up the balance sheet . . . Celebrity magnetism Pinault: He loves the celebrity world and is pals with woke but party-hard A-listers such as actor Woody Harrelson, U2 singer Bono, designer Stella McCartney and actress Charlize Theron. All of them attended his spectacular 2009 wedding to Salma Hayek in Venice. Advertisement Pinault spent ¬£17 million on renovating one of the family's museums, the Punta Della Dogana, for the occasion, although the main reception was in the opera house in Venice, also owned by the family. The weekend reputedly cost ¬£2.6m. Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO of French luxury group Kering. Photo / AP Other pals include actors Hugh Jackman, Eddie Redmayne, Jennifer Aniston, Uma Thurman, Thandie Newton and Jared Leto, plus singers Drake and Madonna, and the Beckhams. He is also friends with oligarch Roman Abramovich. Arnault: Adept at making friends in high places, Arnault was on close terms with the late French President Jacques Chirac. His daughter, Delphine, is now ""besties"" with First Lady Brigitte Macron, wife of Emmanuel, and Mme Macron has been kitted out in Louis Vuitton. Last month, Arnault flew with President Trump in Air Force One to open a Louis Vuitton leatherware workshop in Texas. He was made an honorary knight by the Queen in 2012. Fabulous homes Pinault: His main home is in Paris, base of the Kering business, and he has a vast apartment in the chic 6th arondissement. He and wife Salma Hayek also have a ¬£12m mansion in Bel Air, California, with seven bedrooms and spectacular views of LA ‚Äî bought from Frasier star Kelsey Grammer. Monsieur and Madame, however, are not always to be found at the same address: Hayek moved to stylish Holland Park, West London, with their daughter Valentina four years ago. (Before this, Pinault had a two-bedroomed ¬£20m house in Kensington.) He travels for ""two weeks in four"" but Hayek insists they're never separated for long. Arnault: As well as a house in Paris, he has a mansion in Clairefontaine in the Ile-de-France region at which he weekends. He also owns a 133-acre island, Indigo, in the Bahamas and is a major investor in the redevelopment of the Balkan country Montenegro. Their ooh-la-la love lives! Pinault: Married twice, he has four children: the eldest, Francois and Mathilde, with first wife Dorothee, to whom he was married from 1996 to 2004. His third child, son Augie, came along in October 2006, after he had a relationship with supermodel Linda Evangelista ‚Äî and ushered in a public ding-dong, with a court fight over maintenance. The supermodel asked the court for a whopping ¬£35,000 a month in support for the child, to pay for nannies and armoured cars. Today, though, Pinault insists that Augie is happily part of the family. His relationship with Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek has been far more star-crossed: he was introduced to her at a party in Venice in April 2006, they had daughter Valentina in September 2007 and married on Valentine's Day 2009. Francois-Henri Pinault with wife Salma Hayek. Photo / AP The couple recently renewed their vows while on holiday in Bora Bora in the South Pacific. As romantic as it all sounds, the businessman doesn't seem to have his eye far from the bottom line, even at home. In one interview Hayek said she told Pinault she didn't want to work any more after having their daughter at the age of 41. He replied: ""Oh no, you're going back to work. We're not putting up with some lazy girl in the house. That's not who I married."" Arnault: His life is less chequered than Pinault's. He separated from first wife Anne in 1990. Second wife Helene Mercier, a concert pianist, was wooed by Arnault playing the piano on one of their early dates. Four out of his five children work in the family business. Son Antoine, CEO of Berluti, lives with supermodel Natalia Vodianova, while daughter Delphine is also in a senior management role. From left: Helene Mercier Arnault, Bernard Arnault, Natalia Vodianova and Antoine Arnault. Photo / Getty Images In 2013, Arnault transferred the family fortune to Belgium to prevent squabbling among his five children about who should take over after him. The group will now be run by a trust administered by a former finance minister after Arnault's death. Boys' toys and sporting passions Pinault: Plays tennis twice a week and boxes. The family owns a football team in Brittany and he is proud of his Breton heritage. Drives a rather modest Silver Lexus SUV but is a repeated user of private planes and yachts, which are, apparently, always rented. A fan of Bruce Springsteen and a regular holidaymaker on the French island of St Barthelemy in the Caribbean. His father Francois, 83, is one of the world's foremost art collectors and owns two museums in Venice. He's set to open a new one in Paris next year, which cost an extraordinary ¬£132m to build. After the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in April, Pinault announced a gift of ¬£86m to aid rebuilding. Arnault: A serious art collector, Arnault bought his first painting, Monet's London Bridge, at auction in 1982. It cost him ¬£200,000, but today it is probably worth more like ¬£20m. In 2014, he opened the Louis Vuitton Foundation museum to display his collection of artworks in the Bois de Boulogne just outside Paris. Next year another museum backed by him is to open in the French capital. After Francois Pinault announced his gift to help rebuild Notre Dame, Arnault said he would donate ¬£172m, double Pinault's sum . An accomplished pianist, he also enjoys tennis and has been known to pay Wimbledon champion Roger Federer to coach him . Endlessly ambitious, Arnault said in one interview of his match against Federer: ""Obviously I lost 6-0, but I won a point . . . [this year] my goal is to gain two points against Roger Federer."" His superyacht, Symphony, which can comfortably take 16 guests and 27 staff, has a price tag of ¬£100m, while he also owns a Dassault private jet. Net worth Pinault: Chairman and CEO of the Kering Group, comprising Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Gucci and Christie's auction house. Technically, the empire is owned by his father, Francois, who founded the company, but Francois-Henri has been running it since 2005 and is the CEO and chairman. He is said to be worth ¬£25b.

91,billionaire,At Least 20 Billionaires Behind ‚ÄòDark Money‚Äô Group That Opposed Obama,"A nonprofit group with a bland name, Americans for Job Security, spent $5 million supporting Republicans in the 2010 midterms and $15 million denouncing former President Obama in the 2012 election, but until this week, the group never had to file disclosures showing where its money was coming from.
‚ÄúThis is the first time in the Citizens United-era that a dark money group was forced to disclose their donors in a certain time period,‚Äù said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, referring to the 2010 Supreme Court case that wiped away previous restrictions on political spending .
Americans for Job Security had previously claimed it was not a political organization and therefore did not have to disclose its donors. But after years of litigation, CREW convinced the Federal Election Commission otherwise. AJS filed a list of its backers and beneficiaries from 2010 to 2012 on Thursday.
The biggest individual donor to the group appears to be Charles Schwab , the brokerage titan worth an estimated $7.8 billion. Over the span of three months in 2012, he donated nearly $9 million. Gap cofounder Doris Fisher ‚Äîalong with her sons Robert , John and William ‚Äîgave another $9 million.
Some of the donors‚Äô names have seeped out over the years . In 2013 a California state watchdog agency released a redacted donor list following an investigation conducted by the agency. That redacted list showed donors with mostly California addresses.
The new FEC filing shows billionaire donors from around the country. The late Republican megadonors Richard and Helen DeVos gave $1 million to the group in October 2012. Texas oil-and-gas billionaires Richard Kinder , Dan Wilks , Farris Wilks and late Houston Texans owner Robert McNair were also among the donors that year. Others include Dennis Washington of Montana, who got rich in mining and railroads, and Leon Black of New York, who cofounded private equity giant Apollo. WWE chief executive Vince McMahon donated, along with his wife Linda McMahon, who Donald Trump later appointed to his cabinet.
The companies of several billionaires are also on the list, including Wynn Resorts, which was cofounded by billionaire Steve Wynn and his then-wife Elaine Wynn (Steve Wynn resigned as chairman and CEO in February 2018 and sold all his Wynn Resorts shares), and Bass Pro Shops, the sporting goods retailer founded and majority owned by billionaire John Morris . Wynn Resorts contributed $500,000 and Bass Pro Shops contributed $50,000 in 2012. (Morris himself contributed another $50,000, according to the filing.)
In a letter to the FEC, AJS president Stephen DeMaura said the list was pulled from bank records, spreadsheets and ‚Äúother records,‚Äù noting that it probably included some duplicates. DeMaura could not be reached for comment.
Oct. 27, 2019: This article has been updated to include more details about the billionaires behind two companies that were also donors: Wynn Resorts and Bass Pro Shops.

92,billionaire,Poll Shows Democrats Have Been Living in a Fantasy World,"Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imag In 2018, Democratic candidates waded into hostile territory and flipped 40 House districts, many of them moderate or conservative in their makeup. In almost every instance, their formula centered on narrowing their target profile by avoiding controversial positions, and focusing obsessively on Republican weaknesses, primarily Donald Trump‚Äôs abuses of power and attempts to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans.
The Democratic presidential field has largely abandoned that model. Working from the premise that the country largely agrees with them on everything, or that agreeing with the majority of voters on issues is not necessary to win, the campaign has proceeded in blissful unawareness of the extremely high chance that Trump will win again.
A new batch of swing state polls from the New York Times ought to deliver a bracing shock to Democrats. The polls find that, in six swing states ‚Äî Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona ‚Äî Trump is highly competitive. He trails Joe Biden there by the narrowest of margins, and leads Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Normally, it is a mistake to overreact to the findings of a single poll. In general, an outlier result should only marginally nudge our preexisting understanding of where public opinion stands. This case is different. To see why, you need to understand two interrelated flaws in the 2016 polling. First, they tended to under-sample white voters without college degrees. And this made them especially vulnerable to polling misses in a handful of states with disproportionately large numbers of white non-college voters. The Times found several months ago that Trump might well win 270 Electoral College votes even in the face of a larger national vote defeat than he suffered in 2016.
All this is to say that, if you‚Äôve been relying on national polls for your picture of the race, you‚Äôre probably living in la-la land. However broadly unpopular Trump may be, at the moment he is right on the cusp of victory.
What about the fact Democrats crushed Trump‚Äôs party in the midterms? The new Times polling finds many of those voters are swinging back. Almost two-thirds of the people who supported Trump in 2016, and then a Democrat in the 2018 midterms, plan to vote for Trump again in 2020.
Perhaps some of that movement represents a desire by voters to check Trump‚Äôs power and restore divided government. But the poll contains substantial evidence that Trump‚Äôs party lost the midterms for the hoary yet true reason that Republicans took unpopular positions, especially on health care, and ceded the center. Rather than learn the lesson, Democrats instead appear intent on ceding it right back to them.
The ‚Äúcenter,‚Äù of course, is a somewhat hazy concept, subject both to overinterpretation and misinterpretation. Capturing the center isn‚Äôt the only reason politicians win elections, and some policies that Washington elites consider ‚Äúradical‚Äù are in fact popular. Nonetheless, it really is true that there are a bunch of persuadable voters who can be pushed away from a party based on their perception that it‚Äôs too radical.
And the Democratic presidential primary has been a disaster on this front. The debate has taken shape within a world formed by Twitter, in which the country is poised to leap into a new cultural and economic revolution, and even large chunks of the Democratic Party‚Äôs elected officials and voting base have fallen behind the times. As my colleague Ed Kilgore argues, the party‚Äôs left-wing intelligentsia have treated any appeals to voters in the center as a sign of being behind the times.
Biden‚Äôs paper-thin lead over Trump in the swing states is largely attributable to the perception that he is more moderate than Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. Three-quarters of those who would vote for Biden over Trump, but Trump over Warren, say they would prefer a more moderate Democratic nominee to a more liberal one, and a candidate who would find common ground with Republicans over one who would fight for a progressive agenda.
There are lots of Democrats who are trying to run moderate campaigns. But the new environment in which they‚Äôre running has made it difficult for any of them to break through. There are many reasons the party‚Äôs mainstream has failed to exert itself. Biden‚Äôs name recognition and association with the popular Obama administration has blotted out alternatives, and the sheer number of center-left candidates has made it hard for any non-Biden to gain traction. Candidates with strong profiles, like Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, have struggled to gain attention, and proven politicians like Michael Bennet and Steve Bullock have failed even to qualify for debates.
But in addition to those obstacles, they have all labored against the ingrained perception that the Democratic party has moved beyond Obama-like liberalism, and that incremental reform is timid and boring. The same dynamic was already beginning to form in 2016, though Hillary Clinton overcame it with a combination of name recognition and a series of leftward moves of her own to defuse progressive objections. Biden‚Äôs name brand has given him a head start with the half of the Democratic electorate that has moderate or conservative views. But it‚Äôs much harder for a newer moderate Democrat lacking that established identity to build a national constituency. The only avenue that has seemed to be open for a candidate to break into the top has been to excite activists, who are demanding positions far to the left of the median voter.
The primary has not doomed Democrats. Warren and Sanders are still close enough to Trump that they can compete, and new events, like a recession or another scandal, could erode Trump‚Äôs base. But the party should look at its position a year before the election with real fear. The party‚Äôs presidential field has lost the plot.

October was the warmest such month on record globally, narrowly edging out October 2015 for the top spot, according to a new analysis from the European Union‚Äôs Copernicus Climate Change Service.
The finding, released Tuesday, is significant because it shows that 2019 is certain to be one of the warmest years on record, continuing a trend scientists attribute to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities.
According to Copernicus, global average surface temperatures were 1.24 degrees above average when compared to the 1981-2010 average, and 0.02 degrees above the 2015 record. The month was a solid 0.2 degrees above the third-warmest October, which occurred in 2017.
During October, the Western United States and parts of Canada stood out for being cooler than average. However, temperatures were ‚Äúmarkedly above average‚Äù over much of the Arctic, where sea ice extent hit a record low for the month. Europe was warmer than average, as was the Eastern United States and Canada, the Middle East and much of North Africa and Russia.

A critical witness in the impeachment inquiry offered Congress substantial new testimony this week, revealing that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country likely would not receive American military aid unless it publicly committed to investigations President Trump wanted.
The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in four new pages of sworn testimony released on Tuesday, confirmed his involvement in laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that he had previously not acknowledged. The issue is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into Mr. Trump, which turns on the allegation the president abused his power to extract political favors from a foreign power.
Mr. Trump has consistently maintained that he did nothing wrong and that there was no quid pro quo with Ukraine.

Several Harris aides, current and former, describe a kind of performance anxiety that washes over her in tense times. She can have trouble listening, processing and answering in these moments, they say. She might be too quick to please a questioner.
Or she might engage the premise of their question rather than using it to make her own points. Other times, she reverts to the comfortable scripts in her head out of fear that she might say the wrong thing. Since her campaign began, Harris said on at least three occasions that she misheard a question, most recently when she laughed and seemed to agree when a man at her town hall called Trump‚Äôs agenda ‚Äúmentally retarded.‚Äù Aides played the video back to her. Harris called it ‚Äúupsetting‚Äù and apologized.

One year out from the 2020 election, President Trump trails some potential Democratic rivals in head-to-head matchups, with his national support level currently fixed at about 40 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
The new poll highlights the degree to which most of the country already has made a judgment about the president‚Äôs performance and their voting preferences next year.

93,billionaire,"Warren's wealth tax would solve economic inequality, says economist Gabriel Zucman","Taxing the rich to help the poor and middle class has defined the presidential campaigns of Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
Skeptics of the proposal argue that a wealth tax of this magnitude is impractical, and will not generate the revenue that Senator Warren and supporters anticipate. But French economist Gabriel Zucman, an early proponent of the tax , argues otherwise.
Zucman, now author of the book ‚ÄúThe Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay,‚Äù joined The Final Round to discuss the profound effect the tax system has on American economic inequality, and how a wealth tax could change that.
‚ÄòThe tax system is critically important‚Äô to eradicating economic inequality On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled an education plan that would dramatically increase federal funding for public schools over the next decade, siphoning money raised from her proposed wealth tax to cover the plan‚Äôs $450 billion cost. It is one of many proposals developed by the Massachusetts senator that depend almost wholly upon the success of her controversial wealth tax, which would impose a 2% annual tax on household net worth between $50 million and $1 billion .
Zucman said he believes such a tax could also be a solution to economic inequality exacerbated by the current U.S. tax system.
‚ÄúFinancial deregulation; the collapse of the minimum wage; higher college costs; the declining role of unions. All of these things have mattered a lot [to American economic inequality],‚Äù Zucman said. ‚ÄúBut, when you try to look at the income and the wealth of the very rich, the tax system is critically important. The U.S. used to have the most progressive tax system in the world, with top marginal income tax rates of more than 90% in the post-World War II decades, to estate tax rates to of close to 80% from the 1930s to the 1980s, and then you had a dramatic change in the 1980s. The top marginal income tax rate was reduced to 28%, and today, in 2018, for the first time in the last hundred years, billionaires have paid a lower tax rate ‚Äì all taxes included ‚Äì than the middle class and the working class. They pay 23% of their income in taxes; the rest of the population pays in between 25% and 30% of their income in taxes.‚Äù
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) responds to a question during a forum held by gun safety organizations the Giffords group and March For Our Lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Steve Marcus More Why ‚Äòjust a small wealth tax‚Äô can address systemic inequality in the U.S. ‚ÄúA tax of 2% on the wealth above $50 million and 3% above $1 billion. That tax alone would double the effective tax rate of billionaires, from 23% today to 46%,‚Äù says Zucman. ‚ÄúSecond, it would generate a lot of tax revenue ‚Äì about $2.6 trillion over the next ten years. That‚Äôs money that can be used for childcare, for healthcare, for student debt relief, which would make it possible for the rest of the population to see their income grow more, and to see their wealth grow. So, it cannot fix all the problems; but just a small wealth tax on a tiny fraction of the population, because inequality has increased so much and there is so much wealth at the top, it can go some way towards addressing inequality.‚Äù

Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, has become the world's third-richest person as of the market close for the first time, Forbes magazine said, passing Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc while Bill Gates remained the world's richest person. REUTERS/File Photos More ‚ÄòThe solution is lowering taxes for the working class‚Äô Zucman says Senator Warren‚Äôs wealth tax would alleviate the financial burden currently carried by the American working and middle classes.

94,billionaire,First on CNN: How a Bloomberg-funded gun-control group helped turn Virginia blue - CNNPolitics,"WASHINGTON (CNN) More than $166,000 in contributions, mailings and digital ads to help a political newcomer take on a Republican incumbent in a Richmond-area Senate district. More than $146,000 to help an Air Force veteran seek an open Senate seat in a fast-growing suburban county. About $75,000 to target the only Republican representing Northern Virginia in the state's House of Delegates.
On Tuesday in Virginia, all three seats flipped from Republican to Democrat -- after a $2.5 million spending spree in the state by Everytown for Gun Safety , a gun-control group aligned with billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The investments made the Bloomberg-affiliated organization the largest outside spender in the elections that saw Democrats take control of the state's executive and legislative branches for the first time in a generation. Everytown officials -- who provided CNN with details of their Virginia strategy -- say their approach to the off-year election demonstrates the potency of the gun-safety message one year before the nation heads to the polls to decide control of Congress and the White House. The spending also underscores how aggressively the deep-pocketed group will pursue its agenda in the months ahead. Everytown outspent the embattled National Rifle Association by roughly 8-to-1 in Virginia, plowing money into the state to target vulnerable Republicans months in advance of Tuesday's election. ""Gun safety will be one of the defining issues of 2020,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown. Virginia Republicans went into Tuesday's election defending paper-thin majorities: 20-19 in the state Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with a vacancy in each chamber. Read More Everytown and the Democrats they backed made guns a key issue, following a mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building on May 31 that left 12 people dead. The state's Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a special session of the General Assembly in July to take up an array of gun-control bills, but the Republican leadership abruptly ended the session 90 minutes after it started without considering a single bill. Even before the session began, Everytown strategists began polling to determine which Virginia races would be the most competitive in November should the General Assembly fail to act, said Charlie Kelly, a veteran Democratic strategist who works as a senior adviser to the group. Soon after the adjournment, the group began a digital advertising blitz to target Republicans, particularly in suburban swing districts. ""They made their choice to side with the gun lobby,"" Feinblatt said. Everytown's spending came as the NRA faces intense scrutiny and legal battles with its former advertising agency. The gun lobby's finances are under investigation by attorneys general in New York and Washington. NRA officials this week said it's not uncommon for Bloomberg-funded groups to outspend them in politics and insisted their membership ranks remained strongly committed to the gun-rights cause. ""Anti-gun organizations are backed by distant billionaires, not local interests,"" Jason Ouimet, head of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. ""These elitists funnel money into our communities to prop-up weak candidates defined by one trait: their willingness to bow to the billionaire's gun control agenda, even if it turns great places-like Virginia-into New York City."" By Election Day, Everytown and its grassroots arm, Moms Demand Action, had endorsed Democrats in 25 races. Moms Demand Action volunteers made more than 100,000 calls to voters, Everytown officials said Wednesday. Everytown's heaviest spending went to 15 contests. Those ranged from Washington's outer suburbs where Democratic state Delegate and Air Force vet John Bell captured an open Senate seat that long had been held by Republicans to the Richmond area, where first-time candidate Ghazala Hashmi ousted a Republican incumbent to become the first Muslim elected to Virginia's state Senate. Virginia campaign laws allow outside groups to coordinate directly with candidates and political parties, so Everytown was free to co-produce candidate ads with hyper-local messages. In Bell's case, Everytown underwrote $75,000 in TV advertising. In one ad , Bell proposed increasing the distance between firing ranges and private homes, highlighting recent incidents in his fast-growing suburban area where stray bullets from private ranges have hit homes. Everytown also spent more than $67,000 to aid Democrat Shelly Simonds, who gained national attention in 2017 after a tie with her Republican opponent David Yancey was decided by a random draw out of a bowl. Yancey won the draw two years ago. On Tuesday, Simonds won the rematch by a wide margin. As of early Wednesday morning, Everytown-favored candidates had won in eight of the 15 races and lost in three. Four still were too close to call. Among the biggest losses: The group's attempt to topple Virginia's Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox. Everytown spent more than $184,000 in that race. Cox survived the onslaught but will have to surrender his leadership position now that Democrats will control the chamber. While Everytown emerged as one of the biggest players in Virginia's legislative races, other liberal groups also invested heavily in the state's races. EMILY's List, which backs Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights, teamed up with a leading Democratic political action committee, Priorities USA, to spend more than $2 million in Virginia. A Washington Post poll last month found that gun policy had emerged as the top concern in Virginia , with 75% of registered voters saying it would be a ""very important"" issue as they cast their ballots in legislative contests. This story has been updated with additional information provided by Everytown for Gun Safety

95,billionaire,"When Jacob Rees-Mogg lets slip what he really believes, the choices become clear | Gary Younge | Opinion | The Guardian","His candour revealed a sense of innate superiority. A Labour MP‚Äôs comment about billionaires spoke to very different values, Gary Younge. I n a recent interview, the Indian novelist and campaigner Arundhati Roy described a tabletop mountain in the Indian state of Odisha as a symbol for who or what will rule the world. ‚ÄúFor the mining companies, the mountain is worth the cost of the bauxite that can be mined,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúFor the people ‚Ä¶ who live on that mountain it‚Äôs a water tank [that] has held the water of the monsoons and the plains for centuries. [To them] that bauxite is worth nothing if it‚Äôs outside the mountain.‚Äù That, she said, raises the question, ‚ÄúCan we leave the bauxite in the mountain?‚Äù
Jacob Rees-Mogg's Grenfell remarks 'caused huge distress', admits Tory chairman Read more
Like the tale about the mountain and the decision about the bauxite, politics is, largely, about choices and narratives. It‚Äôs a choice, not simply between different manifestos, policies and programmes, but between competing stories about who we are, what is important, how we got here and where we go next.
This week clearly showcased the value systems underpinning the choice both in this election and in the broader political moment, and how they are framed by the media. They were revealed in remarks made accidentally and extemporaneously in two radio interviews ‚Äì in moments of candour in which the interviewee spoke unselfconsciously in order to make a point, not the news. They went viral because they illustrated bigger truths that are widely held but rarely openly claimed.
The first involved Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, on Radio 5 Live‚Äôs Emma Barnett Gets Answers. Barnett, who does get answers but rarely really listens to them, was quizzing Russell-Moyle about why Labour wanted to broaden the debate beyond Brexit. He steered the conversation towards inequality, saying of the rich: ‚ÄúYou will have a decision. What side are you on? Are you on the side of the tax dodgers and the billionaires or are you on the side of normal working people?‚Äù
‚ÄúSome people aspire to be a billionaire in this country,‚Äù said Barnett. ‚ÄúIs that a dirty thing?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone should be a billionaire,‚Äù replied Russell-Moyle.
The second involved Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, who was asked by Nick Ferrari on LBC if race or class discrimination had anything to do with the Grenfell tragedy. Rees-Mogg said no, pointing instead to the flammable cladding and the residents‚Äô decision to obey the fire brigade‚Äôs demands to stay put. ‚ÄúIf either of us were in a fire,‚Äù he told Ferrari , ‚Äúwhatever the fire brigade said we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do and it‚Äôs such a tragedy that that didn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù
Russell-Moyle let slip a combative vision of a country in which there should be a limit to how much wealth any one individual might have at a time when our schools and hospitals are underfunded, real wages have yet to recover from the financial crisis, and 14 million people live in relative poverty, 4 million of whom are working.
He set that limit pretty high. A billion pounds is a lot of money . Very few people aspire to that level of wealth because it‚Äôs impossible to imagine. It‚Äôs more than anyone can count or spend. In Britain it‚Äôs not the realm of the 1% ‚Äì the targets of Occupy Wall Street ‚Äì but the 0.0002%. Nonetheless, it lays down a clear marker about the kind of country Russell-Moyle does not want to live in ‚Äì where obscene wealth is possible amid widespread poverty. And he makes it clear it‚Äôs a vision he‚Äôs prepared to fight for.
Rees-Mogg gives voice to a sense of innate superiority that comes with the privilege of his class. If he lived in Grenfell Tower he would have survived because, unlike those who died, he has common sense. Having insisted the tragedy had nothing to do with class discrimination, his contempt drips from every word. Drawing Ferrari in to his orbit ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf either of us were in a fire‚Äù ‚Äì you are left wondering what kind of people he thinks were actually in the fire.
His is a world where people who live in tower blocks do not know what‚Äôs best for them and die through deference, obedience or ignorance rather than survive through self-preservation, entitlement and determination. It is, in short, a world in which he is intrinsically better than other people.

Both statements are off the cuff; neither are sanctioned by spin doctors or are official policy. Yet each, in its own way, illustrates the values and priorities of the two major parties: the first uncompromising in its pursuit of a fairer future for everyone; the second arrogantly assuming the unfairness that exists is the fault of those who suffer the most, who should have made better choices.
Meanwhile the responses indicate how those agendas are treated by the media. When Russell-Moyle makes his point he is challenged doggedly. Barnett swaps the faux-outrage that fuels her drivetime shtick for what looks like genuine incredulity, pushing back instantly and insistently. Someone must speak up for billionaires, and Barnett defends them as though they are an oppressed group. ‚ÄúYou are painting all billionaires as offshore, morally base individuals.‚Äù
When Rees-Mogg makes his point, however, he is given free rein. The scandal is not realised in real time ‚Äì the outrage emerges later from social media. Ferrari listens intently while Rees-Mogg prattles on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs rather sad to raise these kinds of points [of racism and classism] over a great tragedy,‚Äù Rees-Mogg says.
‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs a Labour MP who‚Äôs doing it,‚Äù interjects Ferrari.
How to explain Jacob Rees-Mogg? Start with his father's books Read more
Challenge the existence of billionaires and you will be confronted in disbelief; utter a slur against those who die in a fire and you will get an uninterrupted hearing.
Finally, when faced with the furore they have caused, the two politicians‚Äô responses couldn‚Äôt have been more different. Russell-Moyle doubled down , writing on the Guardian website: ‚ÄúThe notion that billionaires should not exist is rather commonplace, and I am confident it‚Äôs an idea shared by the majority of the population.‚Äù
Rees-Mogg folded, issuing an apology in which he claimed he meant to say the exact opposite to what he actually said. Then another Tory MP stepped up to defend him, explaining that what he really meant was that he was cleverer than the fire service chiefs who gave the advice. He too then apologised.
These were only gaffes in the sense that both the Labour and Tory MPs were caught saying out loud what they actually believe. ‚ÄúThe danger when Margaret speaks without thinking,‚Äù the late leader of the House of Commons, Norman St John-Stevas, said of his former boss, Margaret Thatcher, ‚Äúis that she says what she thinks.‚Äù She was not alone. The challenge here is not that you might be caught in a lie. It‚Äôs that you might be caught in the truth and then have to explain yourself.

96,billionaire,The French Economist Who Helped Invent Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Wealth Tax | The New Yorker,"To trace the progress of the wealth tax from a fringe academic idea to the center of the Democratic Presidential primary, it is helpful to begin a bit off-center. On September 15, 2008, the day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, a twenty-one-year-old student of Thomas Piketty, Gabriel Zucman, started work as a trainee economic analyst in the offices of a Paris brokerage house called Exane. Zucman felt obviously underequipped for the task before him: to write memos to the brokerage house‚Äôs clients and traders helping to explain why the very durable and minutely engineered global financial system appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Poring over some of the data he was given, which concerned the international flows of investments, Zucman noticed some strange patterns. The amount of money that had been moving through a handful of very small economies (Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, the tiny Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey) was staggering. ‚ÄúHundreds of billions of dollars,‚Äù Zucman recalled recently, making the ‚ÄúB‚Äù in ‚Äúbillions‚Äù especially emphatic. Eventually, he would calculate that half of all foreign direct investment‚Äîhalf of the risk-seeking bets, placed from overseas in India, China, Brazil, and Silicon Valley, and of the safety-seeking investments, placed in the United States and Europe and stock indexes‚Äîwas moving through offshore hubs like these.
Before the financial crisis, the rise of offshore tax havens hadn‚Äôt been ignored‚Äîone element of the Enron scandal of 2001, for instance, was the eight hundred and eighty-one overseas subsidiaries the company had created, which had helped it avoid paying federal taxes for three years‚Äîbut those stories took place within a more confined and more frankly moral framework: it was a cat-and-mouse plot, about the mobility of wealth, and the fruitless efforts to pursue it. Zucman‚Äôs intuition was that these arrangements did not describe a moral or a legal drama but a macroeconomic one. That much wealth, poorly documented or regulated, might have helped to destabilize the global economy. It also seemed that, if economists were not attuned to the amount of wealth stored in offshore havens, they might also have missed the extent of global inequality, since it was billionaires who stored money in the Cayman Islands, not retirees. ‚ÄúYou know, the way we study inequality is we use survey data, state-tax data,‚Äù Zucman told me, ‚Äúand that‚Äôs not going to capture these Swiss bank accounts.‚Äù After half a year at Exane, Zucman was back in graduate school, working with Piketty on the study of wealth inequality in the United States and Europe that became Piketty‚Äôs landmark book, from 2013, ‚Äú",2019-10-21T23:43:00.000+03:00,newyorker.com,trace|*|progress|*|wealth_tax|*|fringe|*|academic|*|idea|*|center|*|democratic_presidential|*|primary|*|-pron-|*|helpful|*|begin|*|bit|*|center|*|september|*|day|*|lehman|*|brothers|*|file|*|bankruptcy|*|year_old|*|student|*|thomas|*|piketty|*|gabriel|*|zucman|*|start|*|work|*|trainee|*|economic|*|analyst|*|office|*|paris|*|brokerage|*|house|*|exane|*|zucman|*|feel|*|obviously|*|underequipped|*|task|*|-pron-|*|write|*|memo|*|brokerage|*|house|*|client|*|trader|*|help|*|explain|*|durable|*|minutely|*|engineer|*|global|*|financial|*|system|*|appear|*|verge|*|collapse|*|pore|*|datum|*|-pron-|*|concern|*|international|*|flow|*|investment|*|zucman|*|notice|*|strange|*|pattern|*|money|*|handful|*|small|*|economy|*|luxembourg|*|cayman|*|islands|*|tiny|*|channel|*|islands|*|jersey|*|guernsey|*|staggering|*|billion_of_dollar|*|zucman|*|recall|*|recently|*|b|*|billion|*|especially|*|emphatic|*|eventually|*|-pron-|*|calculate|*|half|*|foreign|*|direct|*|investment|*|half|*|risk|*|seek|*|bet|*|place|*|overseas|*|india|*|china|*|brazil|*|silicon_valley|*|safety|*|seek|*|investment|*|place|*|united_states|*|europe|*|stock|*|index|*|offshore|*|hub|*|like|*|financial|*|crisis|*|rise|*|offshore|*|tax|*|haven|*|ignore|*|element|*|enron|*|scandal|*|instance|*|eighty|*|overseas|*|subsidiary|*|company|*|create|*|help|*|-pron-|*|avoid|*|pay|*|federal|*|taxis|*|year|*|story|*|place|*|confined|*|frankly|*|moral|*|framework|*|-pron-|*|cat|*|mouse|*|plot|*|mobility|*|wealth|*|fruitless|*|effort|*|pursue|*|-pron-|*|zucman|*|intuition|*|arrangement|*|describe|*|moral|*|legal|*|drama|*|macroeconomic|*|wealth|*|poorly|*|document|*|regulate|*|help|*|destabilize|*|global|*|economy|*|-pron-|*|economist|*|attune|*|wealth|*|store|*|offshore|*|haven|*|-pron-|*|miss|*|extent|*|global|*|inequality|*|-pron-|*|billionaire|*|store|*|money|*|cayman|*|islands|*|retiree|*|-pron-|*|know|*|way|*|-pron-|*|study|*|inequality|*|-pron-|*|use|*|survey|*|datum|*|state|*|tax|*|datum|*|zucman|*|tell|*|-pron-|*|capture|*|swiss|*|bank_account|*|half|*|year|*|exane|*|zucman|*|graduate|*|school|*|work|*|piketty|*|study|*|wealth|*|inequality|*|united_states|*|europe|*|piketty|*|landmark|*|book
97,billionaire,Why don't rich people just stop working?,"Share on Reddit reddit Are the wealthy addicted to money, competition, or just feeling important? Yes. ""Billionaires should not exist,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said last month. And, at the Democratic presidential debate this week, he said that the wealth disparity in America is ""a moral and economic outrage."" ""Senator Sanders is right,"" said Tom Steyer, a businessman from California who happened to be the only billionaire onstage that night (as far as we know). ""No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires ‚Äî not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,"" noted Senator Amy Klobuchar. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. It's an idea that's going around. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder who is worth close to US$70 billion ($108 billion), is apparently open to it. ""I don't know that I have an exact threshold on what amount of money someone should have,"" he said in livestreamed question-and-answer session with company employees in early October. ""But on some level, no one deserves to have that much money."" Yet here we are, chugging into the 10th year of an extremely top-heavy economic boom in which the 1 percenters, by all statistical measures, have won, creating the greatest wealth disparity since the Jazz Age. This era, in length and gains, dwarfs the ""greed is good"" 1980s, that era of yellow ties, nigiri rolls and designer espresso machines that has come to symbolise gilded excess in popular imagination. And yet the only thing we know in this casino-like economy ‚Äî a casino that may, in fact, soon be shuttered ‚Äî is that for those at the top, too much is never enough. Many normal, non-billionaire people wonder: Why is that? Studies over the years have indicated that the rich, unlike the leisured gentry of old, tend to work longer hours and spend less time socialising. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, whose worth has been estimated in the hundreds of millions, has said that he wakes up at 3:45am to mount his daily assault on his corporate rivals. Elon Musk, the man behind Tesla and SpaceX, is worth some US$23 billion ($35 billion) but nevertheless considers it a victory that he dialled back his ""bonkers"" 120-hour workweeks to a more ""manageable"" 80 or 90. And they continue to diversify. Lady Gaga makes a reported US$1 million ($1.5 million) per show in her residency at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, and has evolved from pop music to conquer film ‚Äî but still also recently unveiled a cosmetics venture with Amazon. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said ""on some level, no on deserves to have that much money"". Photo / AP Almost everything rich people touch makes money, but this current financial inferno has meant little for the bottom 50 per cent of earners in the United States, who have 32 per cent less wealth than they did in 2003. The 1 per cent have, as of last decade, 85 per cent of their net worth tied up in investments like stocks, bonds and private equity, where value has exploded. According to Redfin, the average sale price of properties in the top 5 per cent are up 43 per cent nationally over the past decade, and up even more in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Advertisement Fine vintage watches, which have become a must-have for the young male money class, are exploding in value, with prices on certain five-figure models of Rolexes doubling in just a few years. Gold, once derided as a relic, is up 40 per cent in the past few years. What's happening? No one has a retirement number these days ""What's your number?"" asked anyone caught up in the dot-com boom of the 1990s. Could you retire to Napa with $5 million? $20 million? Some hit their number and some went bust, but Silicon Valley is more than ever a showcase for the unfettered capitalism of 2019. Yet no one seems to talk about their number anymore, said Antonio Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez, who sold a startup to Twitter and served as a Facebook product manager before publishing his memoir, ""Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,"" in 2016. Yesterday's big score is just seed capital for tomorrow's bigger one. ""There's never some omega point,"" Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez, 43, said. ""People who get to that point don't stop once they get there."" ""People say, 'Why don't you develop a hobby, or do philanthropy?' "" Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez said. ""But for many, they simply can't stop doing it. They derive transcendent meaning from capitalism. Without their money, what else would they have?"" Elon Musk is worth US$23 billion. Photo / AP At a time of low taxes, friendly interest rates and torrents of venture capital available to would-be moguls, it's a historical moment in the quest for more among the entrepreneurial class. Tim Ferriss, the life-hacking author and podcast star who was an angel investor in Silicon Valley for nearly a decade, wrote in an email that many of these people have been ""navigating work and life in sixth gear for decades."" Without constant work, we must face the nature of existence ""Once they have no financial need to work ‚Äî are 'post-economic,' as some say in San Francisco ‚Äî they have trouble shifting into lower gears,"" Ferriss wrote. ""They're like drag racers who now have to learn to navigate the turns and intersections of neighbourhoods at 30 mph."" ""Without ambitious projects to fill space,"" he added, ""there is often a void that makes some of the bigger questions hard to avoid. The things you neglected are no longer drowned out by noise; they are the signal. It's like facing the Ghost of Christmas Past."" In a sense, it has been going on in this country for 2 1/2 centuries. ""We are a nation founded on the overthrow of kings and the idle rich, so the hustle is deeply baked into mainstream notions of what it means to be American,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington who is a New York Times opinion contributor. And today's competitive personality types are unable to slow down, in part because they fear slipping from their lofty perches, said Maria Bartiromo, the Fox Business anchor. ""Driven people are just driven,"" she said. ""They want to stay fresh and relevant, and to do that, it requires consistent practice. If you want to win, you need to be all in."" And winning can be collecting the most cash ‚Äî pressing the excitement pedal over and over again, like so many exhausted rats in a cage. Rich people know too many rich people With the number of Americans making US$1 million or more spiking by 40 per cent between 2010 and 2016, according to the Internal Revenue Service, you may think that the rich are finally feeling flush enough to ease up, kick back, chill out. They are not. One recent Harvard survey of 4,000 millionaires found that people worth US$8 million or more were scarcely happier than those worth US$1 million. In a widely cited 2006 study, rich people reported that they spend more time doing things they were required to do. Why do they want to do this to themselves? The fact that there are more rich people who are, in fact, richer than ever may be part of the reason. Sociologists have long talked about ""relative income hypothesis."" We tend to measure material satisfaction by those around us ‚Äî not in absolute terms. ""For most people, enough is enough,"" said Robert Frank, the wealth editor for CNBC and the author of the 2007 book ""Richistan: A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New Rich,"" who has interviewed many plutocrats. ""But there is another group of people, no matter what they have, they have to keep going. I call them 'scorekeepers.' They're truly driven by competitive zeal."" Larry Ellison always felt competitive with Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Photo / Supplied Take Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle. Ellison always felt competitive with Bill Gates and Paul Allen of Microsoft, Frank said. ""So when Paul Allen built his 400-foot boat, Larry Ellison waited until it was done and built a 450-foot boat. Larry Ellison would never be happy until he was No. 1."" Among the very rich, it does not matter that all imaginable material needs have been met, said Edward Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who studies wealth and disparity. ""Among the rarefied group of the extreme rich, social status depends on net worth,"" Wolff wrote in an email. ""Their enhanced wealth allows them to make substantial charitable contributions to institutions like museums and concert halls, that may lead to having a building or the like named after them. Think of the Koch brothers and the New York City Ballet. This is only possible if they can stay ahead of the pack and out-contribute their peers."" Social sampling leads the rich toward a blinkered view that society as a whole is more well-off than it is, feeding their unending need ‚Äî particularly as wealth becomes geographically dense. Nearly 20 per cent of the world's ultra-high-net-worth individuals ‚Äî with assets of US$30 million or more ‚Äî live in just 10 cities around the globe, by one tally. Six of those cities are in the United States. Money is like alcohol but for money Living inside bubbles, the rich need greater excess just to feel the same high, said Steven Berglas, a psychologist, executive coach and author. ""If you're an alcoholic,"" he said, ""you're going to take one drink, two drinks, five drinks, six drinks to feel the buzz. Well, when you get a million dollars, you need 10 million dollars to feel like a king. Money is an addictive substance."" Feeding the addiction becomes even more challenging in a top-heavy economy where the price tags of the status symbols keep adding zeros. For the superrich looking to buy their way in to professional sports, it's no longer enough to have courtside seats or a luxury box. You need a team. They're pricey. The Golden State Warriors, for example, sold in 2010 for an NBA record US$450 million to an ownership group headed by Joe Lacob, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist. The team is now valued at US$3.5 billion. Steve Ballmer is seeking to build a US$1 billion pleasure dome. Photo / Supplied Even that is not enough. Now you have to build the biggest, flashiest arena. The Warriors owners recently put the finishing touches on a gleaming new waterfront arena in San Francisco called the Chase Center. It was financed largely by themselves for US$1.4 billion. Not to be left behind, Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief and owner of the rival Los Angeles Clippers, is seeking to build a US$1 billion pleasure dome of his own in Inglewood, California. Clustered courtside together at the sporting palaces, the celebrities, naturally, begin to envy the fortunes of the moguls near them. Even at the pinnacle of success, entertainers like Mark Wahlberg and Lady Gaga find themselves ""suddenly in the same world with billionaires and financiers who own private jets and have their own boats,"" Frank said. ""There's only so much you can make in entertainment, so they look around and decide that they need to get to the next level that they're encountering socially at the Met Ball and at charity functions."" The opportunity appears endless. But what if it's not? The rich suspect the roller coaster is about to crash As a hedge fund veteran, precious metals adviser and financial author, James Rickards is a rich guy who talks to a lot of other rich guys. They don't always like what he has to say. He believes that the current debt-fueled recovery may be a prelude for an economic collapse to dwarf the Great Recession. Until recently, he said, such theories were met with polite lack of interest by many wealthy people. Lately, something has changed. ""Literally, in a matter of weeks, certainly a couple of months, the phone calls have had a different tone to them,"" Rickards said. ""What I'm hearing is, 'I've got the money. How do I hang on to it?' 'Are gold futures going to hold up or should I have bullion?' 'If I have bullion, should I put it in a bag in a private vault?' "" ""It's a level of concern that I've never heard from the superrich,"" he said. ""The tone of voice is, 'I need an answer now!'"" It is not just the rockiness of the stock market. The fears of the wealthy seem to be of a more existential nature. It is as if the very people who have profited most from these good times cannot believe that times are good ‚Äî or that they will stay good, in the event of, say, a Bernie Sanders presidency. Lady Gaga makes a reported US$1 billion per Las Vegas show. Photo / AP Paul Singer, who oversees the behemoth Elliot Management fund, is reportedly tapping investors for billions as a war chest for a possible market implosion. Among the tech zillionaire classes, a place to bug out in the event of an economic collapse, environmental disaster or violent uprising became the thing to have. After he left Facebook, Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez himself bought 5 wooded acres on an island in the Pacific Northwest equipped with generators and solar panels, as The New Yorker reported in 2017. When any part of the denial of rich people gets punctured, the boom reveals itself to be a very weird boom. The profits themselves are confusing. Even some who have ridden the wave to outsize fortunes see something amiss. Marc Benioff, a chief executive of Salesforce.com, recently declared that ""capitalism as we know it is dead."" Corporate earnings are often tepid, yet stocks in those same companies are soaring, thanks in part to stock buybacks that fatten executive compensation but do little to help the business. Some even notice the rest of us out here. Ray Dalio, the hedge fund billionaire, recently wrote an essay on LinkedIn that capitalism ""is not working well for the majority of Americans because it's producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots."" And for those who amass fortunes, the money is the only measure of success they have, said Jordan Belfort, the real-life inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street. As opposed to people who build businesses that make actual products, ""a lot of Wall Street traders didn't create anything ‚Äî all they did was trade on the value and ingenuity of what other people created, so at the end of the day, what can they point to that's tangible?"" Belfort said. (He disavowed his former excess after a prison stint and became a motivational speaker.) ""All they have is money,"" he said. ""So they go out and buy a house and a fancy car, and that feels good for a short while, then they buy a second house and a fancier car. Because all they have is what they earn. They're defined by it."" The newly rich from normal backgrounds are the most anxious of all, said Jennifer Streaks, a personal finance commentator and CNBC contributor. ""Imagine growing up middle class or even poor and then amassing millions,"" Streaks said. ""This sounds like the American dream, but suddenly you have a US$5 million apartment, a US$200,000 car and a family that has these expectations."" A panic ensues when those people believe ""that they are one bad investment away from being broke."" And the rich become anxious and isolated It's not like Jeff Bezos, the US$110 billion man, is going to have to auction off his US$65 million Gulfstream jet if he makes a bad bet on Amazon delivery drones (or goes through a US$36 billion divorce). Even so, the isolation that often accompanies extreme wealth can provide an emotional impulse to keep on earning, long after material comforts have been met, said T. Byram Karasu, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx who said he has worked with numerous high earners in his private practice. Apex entrepreneurs and financiers, after all, are often ""adrenaline-fueled, transgressive people,"" Karasu said. ""They tend to have laser-focused digital brains, are always in transactional mode, and the bigger they get, the lonelier they are, because they do not belong."" Berglas, a onetime member of the Harvard Medical School faculty in psychology, said: ""If you can't relate to people, you presume that the failure to have rewarding relationships is because of jealousy ‚Äî your house is three-X your neighbours', and they look at your brand-new Corvette and drool. It's a compensatory mechanism ‚Äî 'I might not have a ton of friends, but I can do anything I want and I'm the most powerful SOB there is."" Limitless opportunity, extreme isolation. They already own the present. What else is left to buy but tomorrow, and the tomorrow after that? Suddenly, the fetish of the superrich for space tourism starts to make sense.

98,billionaire,Mark Zuckerberg Argues High Taxes On Wealthy Could Stifle Innovation In Human Suffering,"SEE MORE: Mark Zuckerberg Photo: The Onion
PALO ALTO, CA‚ÄîWarning that progressive Democrats‚Äô plans to fund government projects through tax increases on billionaires would have significant negative consequences, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg reportedly argued Monday that high taxes on the wealthy could stifle innovation in human suffering. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs anything that the rise of Silicon Valley has taught us, it‚Äôs that in order to make trailblazing breakthroughs in cruelty and technological oppression, we need to empower the private sector,‚Äù said Zuckerberg, adding that without the promise of being able to fund and ultimately make money off of his inventions, he would have never worked to erode civil liberties, invade people‚Äôs privacy on a grand scale, and manipulate the democratic process by creating Facebook. ‚ÄúIf we want the kind of brutal, intrusive solutions that the market can provide, we can‚Äôt punish those who have risen to the top based on their genius at perpetuating human suffering. Take the medical industry for example‚Äîsure, government agencies and public-sector grants can help researchers develop lifesaving medicines, but only visionaries driven by the promise of unimaginable wealth can come up with ingenious ways to drive people into cycles of addiction or massive medical debt. If we stifle the creative potential of our country‚Äôs most successful business people, think of all the devastation and daily compromises on people‚Äôs lives that we may never discover.‚Äù Zuckerberg did concede that raising taxes on the richest Americans would help relieve the immense pressure to find innovative ways to hide their wealth from the government.

99,billionaire,Virginia cyclist who flipped off Trump's motorcade appears to have won race for local office | Fox News,"Juli Briskman, 51, ran against Suzanne M. Volpe, a Republican who represents the Algonkian District on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. Unofficial returns showed Briskman with 52 percent of the votes after 99 percent of the vote was reported, according to the Associated Press.
Republicans have dominated the board in an otherwise blue county that has largely voted for Democratic candidates in state and federal elections. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by 17 percentage points.
""We worked hard to flip his seat and unseat an eight-year incumbent,"" Briskman said in a statement. ""I‚Äôm looking forward to working with the new board to make better decisions on schools, intelligent development and gun-sense issues.""
Briskman launched her campaign for office after she was fired from a government contracting firm for violating the ‚Äúcode-of-conduct policy."" She&apos;d revealed to her bosses at Virginia-based Akima LLC that she was the woman in a viral photo on social media who was flipping off President Trump&apos;s motorcade.

An individual on behalf of Briskman launched a crowdfunding campaign for her, which raised nearly $140,000 in donations, and Briskman unsuccessfully sued the company for violating her First Amendment rights. ‚ÄúWe have a right to peacefully protest and criticize and express dissent toward our government,‚Äù she told The Washington Post at the time.
""I think the Constitution grants me that privilege,‚Äù she said.
After her case was dismissed, she announced that she would run for local office ‚Äúbecause I feel I can more successfully effect change by serving in local government than by fighting an uphill battle in unfriendly courts,‚Äù she wrote in a post on her crowdfunding page.

100,bitcoin,"English majors are down 25.5 percent since the Great Recession, just as world‚Äôs top economists say we need more ‚Äôstorytellers.‚Äô - The Washington Post","Follow October 19, 2019 at 9:52 AM EDT A great migration is happening on U.S. college campuses. Ever since the fall of 2008, a lot of students have walked out of English and humanities lectures and into STEM classes, especially computer science and engineering. English majors are down more than a quarter (25.5 percent) since the Great Recession, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics. It‚Äôs the biggest drop for any major tracked by the center in its annual data and is quite startling, given that college enrollment has jumped in the past decade. Ask any college student or professor why this big shift from studying Chaucer to studying coding is happening and they will probably tell you it‚Äôs about jobs. As students feared for their job prospects, they ‚Äî and their parents ‚Äî wanted a degree that would lead to a steady paycheck after graduation. The perception is that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) is the path to employment. Majors in computer science and health fields have nearly doubled from 2009 to 2017. Engineering and math have also seen big jumps. AD AD As humanities majors slump to the lowest level in decades, calls are coming from surprising places for a revival. Some prominent economists are making the case for why it still makes a lot of sense to major (or at least take classes) in humanities alongside more technical fields. Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller‚Äôs new book ‚Äú Narrative Economics ‚Äù opens with him reminiscing about an enlightening history class he took as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. He wrote that what he learned about the Great Depression was far more useful in understanding the period of economic and financial turmoil than anything he learned in his economic courses. The whole premise of Shiller‚Äôs book is that stories matter. What people tell each other can have profound implications on markets ‚Äî and the overall economy. Examples include the ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù stories about bitcoin or the ‚Äúanyone can be a homeowner‚Äù stories that helped drive the housing bubble. AD AD ‚ÄúTraditional economic approaches fail to examine the role of public beliefs in major economic events ‚Äî that is, narrative,' Shiller wrote. ‚ÄúEconomists can best advance their science by developing and incorporating into it the art of narrative economics.‚Äù Shiller, who is famous for predicting the dot-com crash and coming up with the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, is spending a lot of time looking at old newspaper clippings to understand what stories and terms went viral and how they influenced people to buy things ‚Äî or stop buying things. When asked if he‚Äôs essentially arguing for more English and history majors, Shiller said, ‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúCompartmentalization of intellectual life is bad.‚Äù AD Shiller isn‚Äôt alone in wishing that there were more storytellers (and story analyzers) around. Every August, some of the world‚Äôs top economists gather in Jackson Hole, Wyo., to discuss how the economy is doing and how they should tweak their models. On the final day of events this year, Philip Lowe, head of Australia‚Äôs central bank, urged his colleagues to spend a little less time on numbers and more time on being good storytellers. AD ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important we don‚Äôt just talk about numbers, coefficients and rules, but stories that people can understand,‚Äù Lowe said. ‚ÄúStories about how policies are contributing to economic welfare and the things that really matter to people.‚Äù Lowe‚Äôs words struck a nerve, partly because Australia has not had a recession in more than 25 years and partly because central bankers around the room generally agreed that their communication could be better. AD One economist pointed out that Jamaica‚Äôs central bank is employing reggae artists to explain that ‚Äú high inflation is a wicked ting. ‚Äù The Federal Reserve doesn‚Äôt have anything quite like that, but it is searching for a senior speechwriter who can help top central bank officials speak ‚Äúto a wide variety of audiences.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am expected to be, and I am, a storyteller. I tell stories about the future,‚Äù said Stefan Ingves, governor of Sweden‚Äôs central bank. ‚ÄúWe human beings simply love stories about the future. That‚Äôs part of my job.‚Äù Ingves reminded his colleagues that they have a big platform that allows them to talk to business leaders and the public about the economy. If they tell a convincing story that growth will continue, people are likely to say, ‚ÄúHmm, that‚Äôs reasonable.‚Äù That could help keep confidence high, allowing company presidents to keep hiring and consumers to keep spending. As the global economy slows to its lowest rate in a decade , worries are high about how much longer the economy can power on. In many ways, President Trump‚Äôs constant attempts to call this the greatest economy of all time are an effort to tell a positive story to encourage Americans to keep spending, Shiller said, even if his claim is not based in fact. AD AD Perhaps the most powerful argument for why students (and their parents) might want to think twice about abandoning humanities is the data. The National Center for Education Statistics also keeps track of pay and unemployment rates by major. There‚Äôs no denying that the typical computer science major makes more money shortly after graduation than the typical English major. Contrary to popular belief, English majors ages 25 to 29 had a lower unemployment rate in 2017 than math and computer science majors. That early STEM pay premium also fades quickly, according to research by David J. Deming and Kadeem L. Noray from Harvard. After about a decade, STEM majors start exiting their job fields as their skills are no longer the latest and greatest. In contrast, many humanities majors work their way to high-earning management positions. By middle age, average pay looks very similar across many majors. AD AD ‚ÄúBy age 40, the earnings of people who majored in fields like social science or history have caught up,‚Äù wrote David Deming in a recent New York Times op-ed. In management and leadership positions, communication is key, as leading economists and central bankers have been quick to point out at this critical juncture for the world economy.

101,bitcoin,We found a massive spam operation and sunk its server TechCrunch,"We found a massive spam operation ‚Äî and sunk its server Five million emails in ten days Zack Whittaker @zackwhittaker / 7 months For ten days in March, millions were caught in the same massive spam campaign.
Each email looked like it came from someone the recipient knew: the spammer took stolen email addresses and passwords, quietly logged into their email account, scraped their recently sent emails and pushed out personalized emails to the recipient of that sent email with a link to a fake site pushing a weight loss pill or a bitcoin scam.
The emails were so convincing more than 100,000 people clicked through.
We know this because a security researcher found the server leaking the entire operation. The spammer had forgotten to set a password.
Security researcher Bob Diachenko found the leaking data and with help from TechCrunch analyzed the server. At the time of the discovery, the spammer‚Äôs rig was no longer running. It had done its job, and the spammer had likely moved onto another server ‚Äî likely in an effort to avoid getting blacklisted by anti-spam providers. But the server was primed to start spamming again.
Given there were more than three million unique exposed credentials sitting on this spammer‚Äôs server ‚Äî hosted on intelimost.com , we wanted to secure the data as soon as possible. With no contact information for the spammer ‚Äî surprise, surprise ‚Äî we asked the hosting provider, Awknet, to pull the server offline. Within a few hours of making contact, the provider nullrouted the server, forcing all its network traffic into a sinkhole.
TechCrunch provided a copy of the database to Troy Hunt . Anyone can now check breach notification site Have I Been Pwned to see if their email was misused.
But the dormant server ‚Äî while it was still active ‚Äî offered a rare opportunity to understand how a spam operation works.
The one thing we didn‚Äôt have was the spam email itself. We reached out to dozens of people to ask about the email they received. Two replied ‚Äî but only one still had a copy of the email. The email sent by the spammer. (Image: supplied)
‚ÄúThe same mail appeared on three occasions,‚Äù said one of the recipients in an email to TechCrunch. ‚ÄúThe subject was related to an email I had sent previously to that person so the attacker had clearly got access to his mailbox or the mail server,‚Äù the victim said.
The email, when clicked, would direct the recipient through several websites in quick succession to determine where they were located, based off their IP address. If the recipient was in the U.S., they‚Äôd be pushed to a fake CNN site promoting a bogus health remedy. In this case, the spammer was targeting U.K. residents ‚Äî and most were directed to a fake BBC page promoting a bitcoin scam. One of the fake page.s (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
The spammer had other servers that we had no visibility into, but the exposed server revealed many of the cogs and machinery to the operation. The server, running an Elasticsearch database, was well-documented enough that we found one of the three spam emails sent to our recipient.
This entry alone tells us a lot about how the spam operation worked. A database record of one email sent by the spammer. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Here‚Äôs how it works. The spammer logs into a victim‚Äôs @btinternet.com email account using their stolen email address and password. The scammer pulls a recently sent email from their victim‚Äôs email server, which feeds into another server ‚Äî like inbox87.host and viewmsgcs.live ‚Äî tasked with generating the personalized spam email. That email incorporates the subject line of the sent email and the target recipient‚Äôs email address to make it look like it‚Äôs being sent from the real person.
Once the message is ready to send, it‚Äôs pushed through a proxy connection, designed to mask where the email has come from. The proxy server is made up of several cell phones, each connecting to the internet over their cellular connection.
Each spam message is routed through one of the phones, which occasionally rotates its IP address to prevent detection or being flagged as a spammer.
Here‚Äôs what that proxy server looks like. The proxy server comprised of several cell phones with rotating IP addresses. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Once the spam message leaves the proxy server, the spam message is pushed through the victim‚Äôs own email provider using their email address and password, making it look like a genuine email to both the email provider and the recipient.
Now imagine that hundreds of times a second.
Not only was the spammer‚Äôs Elasticsearch database leaking, its Kibana user interface was also exposed. That gave the spammer a detailed at-a-glance look at the operation in action. It was so granular that you could see which spam-sending domains were the most efficient in tricking a recipient into clicking the link in the spam email. The spammer‚Äôs Kibana dashboard, displaying the operation at a glance. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Each spam email includes a tracker in the link that fed information back to the spammer. In bulk, that allows the spammer to figure out which email domain ‚Äî like outlook.com or yahoo.com users ‚Äî is more likely to click on a spam email. That can also indicate how an email provider‚Äôs spam filter acts. The greater number of clicks, the more likelihood of its spam going through ‚Äî allowing the spammer to target specific email domains in the future.
The dashboard also contained other information related to the spam campaign, such as how many emails were successfully sent and how many bounced. That helps the spammer home in on the most valuable logins in the future, allowing them to send more spam for lower bandwidth and server costs.
In all, some 5.1 million emails were sent during the 10-day campaign ‚Äî between March 8 and March 18, with some 162,980 people clicking on the spam email, according to the data on the dashboard.
It‚Äôs not the first time we‚Äôve seen a spam operation in action , but it‚Äôs rare to see how successful it is.
‚ÄúThis case reminds me on several other occasions I reported at some points in the past ‚Äî when malicious actors create a sophisticated system of proxying and logging, leaving so much tracks to identify their patterns for authorities in the investigations to come,‚Äù Diachenko told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúThis shows us ‚Äî again! ‚Äî how important a proper cyber hygiene should be.‚Äù
What‚Äôs clear is that the spammer knows how to cover their tracks.
The language settings in the Kibana instance suggested the spammer may be based in Belgium. We found several other associated spamming domains using data collected by RiskIQ , a cyberthreat intelligence firm, which scours the web for information. Of the domains we found, all were registered with fake names and addresses.
As for the server itself, the provider said it was possibly hacked.
‚ÄúThis was a resold box and the customer already responded to the abuse forward saying it was supposed to have been terminated long ago,‚Äù said Awknet‚Äôs Justin Robertson in an email to TechCrunch.
And we still can‚Äôt figure out where the email addresses and passwords came from used to send the spam. Only 45 percent of emails were already in Have I Been Pwned, ruling out the possibility that all of the passwords were stolen from credential stuffing .
Since the hosting provider pulled the spammer‚Äôs server offline, several of their fake sites and domains associated with the spam campaign no longer load.
But given the spread of domains and servers propping up the campaign, we suspect the sunken server is only a single casualty in an otherwise ongoing spam campaign.

103,bitcoin,How Facebook‚Äôs Libra would work: Yahoo U,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers this week on the company's cryptocurrency project Libra. The project has attracted the attention of regulators and policymakers all over the world. But what is Libra, and how does it work?"" data-reactid=""15"">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers this week on the company's cryptocurrency project Libra. The project has attracted the attention of regulators and policymakers all over the world. But what is Libra, and how does it work? Among many other talking points, Zuckerberg made a point of calling Libra a payment system, and not money. As Facebook laid out in its white paper in June, Libra is intended to be a way to send money instantly, with low fees, to people all over the world. Currently, sending money abroad (through SWIFT interbank transfers or wire services like Western Union) can take several days. These processes can also be pretty expensive. With Libra, a Facebook user would sign up for a ‚ÄúCalibra‚Äù wallet and send units of Libra to another Calibra wallet holder. Since there are no transacting banks in this case, the transfer happens instantaneously on Facebook‚Äôs blockchain. There's no multi-day delay in debiting and crediting the money from one bank to the other. But what makes Libra novel and different from Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is its partnership with a consortium of companies like Lyft, Uber, Spotify, and Vodafone to help it develop and use the blockchain. Instead of having to convert the Libra into domestic currency to call an Uber or pay for your monthly Vodafone bill, users could pay directly in units of Libra. That would dramatically, in theory, reduce the costs of foreign exchange conversion. But a slew of companies have bailed from the project: Booking Holdings, Mercado Pago, PayPal, eBay, MasterCard, and also Visa and Stripe. David Marcus, the head of the Facebook subsidiary heading Libra‚Äôs development, told Yahoo Finance that non-founding members of Libra will still be able to transact in Libra whenever the project launches. Libra concerns The exodus of companies from the project is just one problem facing Libra. Regulators have also expressed worry about the financial stability of the project. Facebook has 2.7 billion users and if a substantial amount of people on that platform opt to use Calibra wallets as a de facto bank, there are concerns that the blockchain could be large enough to present what they call ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù risk to the financial system . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has shared this concern with Congress. Facebook acknowledges this risk. ‚ÄúWe should assume that there is a chance that this could have systemic risk and design it in a way that it cannot become a systemic risk,‚Äù Marcus told Yahoo Finance. Libra also bills itself as what they call a ‚Äúpseudonymous‚Äù set up, where Calibra wallets are tied to addresses that are not linked to their real world identities. This raises questions about how authorities follow the money if Libra is being used for illegal activities. There's also privacy concerns. Facebook was fined $5 billion from the FTC for privacy reasons earlier in the year. Although Facebook insists that its subsidiary company, Calibra, will be handling the project separately, lawmakers have pressed hard on Zuckerberg to assure that users will be protected. Libra has targeted a launch date of the first half of 2020. But Zuckerberg told Capitol Hill earlier this week that they won't launch it until U.S. regulators give them the green light.

104,bitcoin,,"Scam artists are using phone numbers from more than a dozen federal government departments to defraud Canadians ‚Äî making it look as if the calls are coming from legitimate government agencies and police departments ‚Äî CBC News has learned.
Some of the calls tell potential victims that their social insurance numbers have been compromised. Others are told that they owe the government money and are in legal trouble.
To deceive potential victims who examine the numbers on incoming calls, the scammers spoof their calls so that they display the phone numbers of the relevant federal government departments. In many cases, a scammer tells a victim they will be getting a call from a police officer ‚Äî then spoofs the call that comes in a few minutes later so that it appears to be coming from local police.
""It's hitting lots of Canadians,"" said Jeff Thomson of the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. His own organization has been hit by the scam, with fraudsters pretending to be calling from his office.
""It's inundating police departments and it's inundating us with a number of calls. So it's a huge impact. We've seen a huge spike in the reporting on this fraud.""
Thomson said he received four scam calls on his own personal phone inside of one week.
Scam undermining work of federal departments The scam is having an impact on the ability of government departments to serve the public because they are being bogged down with phone calls from Canadians checking to see whether the calls they're getting are legitimate.
Federal government officials were unable to say just how many departments and agencies have been affected to date by the scam. But CBC News has identified a dozen ‚Äî including bodies like the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, local RCMP divisions, the Competition Bureau and the Cybersecurity Centre which are supposed to help protect Canadians.
The calls spoofing the phone numbers of several different government departments appear to be part of a newer, more sophisticated version of a scam that has been running since at least 2014. That older scam involves fraud artists claiming to be agents of the Canada Revenue Agency, while the newer scam impersonates more government departments.
In 2018, a CBC Marketplace investigation into the CRA phone scam tracked the calls to a call centre in Mumbai, India.
Since 2014, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre has received 78,472 reports from across Canada of scammers pretending to represent the CRA or Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. The centre said 4,695 people across Canada have lost more than $16.7 million to the scam.
That doesn't include people like Andrea van Noord of Vancouver, who lost $6,000 last week to the scam.
The series of events that cleaned out her bank account started when she picked up her cellphone to hear a recorded message claiming to come from the CRA.
'I was panicked' ""I do owe them a small sum of money ... so when I heard that not pressing one would be tantamount to not showing up in court to deal with that issue, I was panicked,"" she said. ""So I pressed one.""
A woman asked her to confirm her identity, then told her that her social insurance number had been used in a $3 million fraud involving 25 credit cards. When the woman asked if her personal information could have been stolen, van Noord thought immediately of the laptop filled with personal information that had been stolen from her car a year ago.
The unknown woman then volunteered to help by contacting Vancouver police and starting a process to clear her name. Minutes later, when van Noord's phone rang, it displayed the Vancouver police department's phone number, spoofed by the scammers.
A separate woman, claiming to be a Vancouver police officer, told her that a 1998 Toyota Camry registered in her name had been abandoned in North Vancouver with bloodstains on the back seat and the trunk. A house, also registered in her name, was found with 22 pounds of cocaine inside, the phoney officer told her.
""It all just seemed very plausible to me and very scary,"" van Noord said. ""They said at this time there was a warrant for my arrest and I was currently being charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and fraud against the Canada Revenue Agency.""
The fake police officer claimed there was a series of bank accounts in her name and asked van Noord about her actual bank accounts and how much money they contained.
'I felt like an idiot' The fraudster told her she had to withdraw her money within the hour to protect it before the account was frozen. Keeping her on the phone the entire time, the scammer instructed her to take a cab to her bank and coached her as she withdrew the money., then told her to take it to a caf√© with a bitcoin machine (described as a ""government wallet safe machine"") that would ""protect"" her money.
It was only later in the day, after she talked with her partner, that she realized she had been robbed.
""I felt like an idiot,"" she said. ""I felt completely invaded. I felt kind of dirty. I felt that this was very much my fault and that I should have recognized the signs.""
Van Noord said both of the people she spoke with had accents that suggested they were based in India.
Police told her there wasn't much they could do.
Thomson said van Noord's experience is not unique.
""These calls are very alarming,"" he said. ""The callers will present themselves as a government official. They will sound very official. They will use a badge number. They will say they are an officer or special agent or an official-sounding title to give themselves some credibility.
""They will sound very formal and they will come across as very threatening and ask you to act right away.""
Thomson said the centre is still getting reports of scammers claiming to be from the CRA but, increasingly, they have been posing as representatives of other government departments.
He said those behind the scam are based overseas.
Marketplace Police raid Indian call centres linked to 'CRA phone scam' that have victimized Canadians Marketplace As RCMP raids target India over CRA phone scam, possible Canadian collaborators have reason to be nervous MARKETPLACE RCMP probe of international CRA phone scam IDs Canadian suspects ""If you have fraudsters operating in one country, targeting consumers in another country and money going to yet a third country, they're clearly organized,"" he said. ""It's organized crime and it's international in scope.""
Isabelle Maheu is a spokeswoman for Employment and Social Development Canada, which includes Service Canada. She said the fraudulent calls are affecting the government's ability to provide services to Canadians.
""Wary Canadians who receive a suspicious incoming phone call frequently disconnect the call and call the government to verify the legitimacy of the call,"" she explained. ""This can result in an increase in call volume and caller wait times. Additionally, legitimate phone calls from government departments can be dismissed as fraudulent, leading to the recipient of the call not receiving important information.""
Many of the departments whose numbers are being spoofed have put notices on their websites warning Canadians.
Meanwhile, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has given telecommunications providers until Dec. 19, 2019 to implement a system to block calls in their networks to crack down on nuisance and illegitimate calls.
Here's a list of some of the federal departments, agencies and courts whose phone numbers are being spoofed:

105,bitcoin,Police warn of new twist in phone scam targeting Canadians | CTV News,"TORONTO -- Scammers have defrauded Canadians out of tens of millions of dollars over the past decade pretending to be collecting back taxes with the Canada Revenue Agency‚Äîbut police are warning of a new twist on the old scam.
The scammers are pretending to be officers with local police forces, investigators said.
The thieves are also using caller ID spoofing so it looks like the call is coming from a police phone number.
Toronto Police Const. David Hopkinson said that officers do not collect taxes on behalf of the government.
‚ÄúThe Toronto Police isn't involved with the Canada Revenue Agency with regards to the collection of money and the Canada Revenue Agency does not collect money in this fashion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust because it says police there are ways to change the identification on the phone to say police.‚Äù
In the past few weeks, Toronto police say one victim gave the scammers $1,200 using a Bitcoin machine after he was told he would be deported if he didn‚Äôt pay.
A woman was told her Social Insurance Number was being used for fraudulent activity and she must immediately pay $1,000 or she would be arrested. She also paid in Bitcoin.
The Canada Revenue Agency will never call and use nasty language or threaten a customer. They will also never ask for credit card information, personal information by email or text, or request your social insurance number or ask for bank account information.
If you get a call that seems suspicious, do not engage the caller and just hang up.
‚ÄúWe need to get the message out so people aren't giving up their money to scammers on the phone,"" Hopkinson said.

106,bitcoin,"Square, Qualcomm, Roku earnings ‚Äî What to know in markets Wednesday","Several large-cap companies will be in focus reporting quarterly results Wednesday.
After the market close, Square ( SQ ), Qualcomm ( QCOM ) and Roku ( ROKU ) are scheduled to deliver their earnings reports.
Square‚Äôs third quarter results follow a noisy second quarter. The company beat on the top and bottom lines, but shares fell 8% on August 1, after the payment company reported a slight miss on gross payment volume and issued weaker-than-expected adjusted EPS guidance.
During the second quarter, Square‚Äôs Cash peer-to-peer app, which is seen as competition to PayPal‚Äôs Venmo, generated $135 million excluding bitcoin trading. Given the continued strength of the Cash app, analysts believe that the current full-year guidance is rather conservative.
In addition, after purchasing Caviar for $44 million in 2014, Square announced in August that it would be selling Caviar to rival DoorDash for $410 million. The deal closed on November 1.
Square is expected to report adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share on $597.14 million of revenue, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, after a lesser-than-impressive third quarter, semiconductor giant Qualcomm is expected to show improvement when it reports fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell Wednesday. Though more information on 5G will be expected, analysts have expressed concern around 5G chip competition.
Qualcomm noted that it was extremely well positioned as 5G ramps in early calendar year 2020. ‚ÄúToday, we are the only chipset vendor that has 5G system level solutions spanning both sub6 GHz and millimeter bands. This is key to global deployments,‚Äù CEO Steve Mollenkopf said during the third-quarter conference call. ‚ÄúOn the product side, our 5G design wins have doubled since our last earnings call. We now have over one hundred fifty 5G designs launched or in-development using our 5G chipsets.‚Äù
According to Mollenkopf, ‚ÄúBy the first calendar quarter of 2020, we anticipate reaching the inflection point as our financial results begin to reflect the benefits of our substantial efforts over the years in to bring 5G to the market worldwide.‚Äù
Qualcomm is expected to report adjusted earnings of 71 cents per share on $4.71 billion in revenue. The options market is implying a 5.4% move in either direction for the stock following the announcement.
NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 29: A view of Roku at IGNITION: Future of Media at Time Warner Center on November 29, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images) More Finally, streaming player Roku is expected to continue to see a bump from the acceleration in cord-cutting. Analysts predict that strong advertising gains will have boosted Roku‚Äôs revenue during the third quarter. As pay-tv continues to lose subscribers at a rapid clip, companies that focus on streaming and over-the-top (OTT) services are seen to reap the benefits.
‚ÄúA Roku sponsored study predicts ~60MM TV households are expected to access video exclusively through streaming within the next five years, surpassing traditional Pay TV viewers for the first time,‚Äù RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients Sunday. ‚ÄúThis shift has been and will continue to be a key growth driver for streaming content aggregators like Roku.‚Äù
With Apple TV+ officially launched and Disney+ and HBO Max expected to launch soon, investors will be listening for additional commentary from Roku‚Äôs management on the potential impact to Roku‚Äôs business.
Roku is expected to report an adjusted earnings loss of 26 cents per share on $257 million in revenue during its third quarter, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The options market is implying a 16.4% move in either direction for Roku stock following the announcement.
Other notable earnings reports scheduled for Wednesday include Wendy‚Äôs ( WEN ), Coty ( COTY ), Capri Holdings ( CPRI ), CVS ( CVS ) before market open; Wynn Resorts ( WYNN ), Humana ( HUM ), Expedia ( EXPE ), Marathon Oil ( MRO ), Fox ( FOXA ), TripAdvisor ( TRIP ), IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IAC ), Fitbit ( FIT ), Baidu ( BIDU ) after market close.

107,bitcoin,The single best investment for the next decade - MarketWatch,"‚ÄúFor money you wouldn‚Äôt need for more than 10 years, which ONE of the following do you think would be the best way to invest it‚Äîstocks, bonds, real estate, cash, gold/metals, or bitcoin/cryptocurrency?‚Äù
That question was recently asked of more than a thousand investors in a recent Bankrate survey , and the winner‚Äîby a large margin‚Äîwas real estate. For every two respondents who answered stocks there were more than three who said real estate is the way to go.
Are these investors onto something? Have financial planners been wrong all these years? For this column I mine the historical data for answers.
On the face of it, the respondents to the survey need to go back to their history books, as pointed out in a recent column by my colleague Catey Hill . Since 1890, U.S. real estate has produced an annualized return above inflation of just 0.4%, as judged by the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index and the consumer-price index. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.07% (or its predecessor indexes) did far better, outpacing inflation at a 6.3% annualized rate (when including dividends).
Even long-term U.S. Treasury Bonds outperformed real estate, producing an annualized inflation-adjusted total return of 2.7%. Check out the chart below:
If this were the end of the story, then this column could end here.
But it‚Äôs not the end. The stock and bond markets are currently so overvalued that it‚Äôs not only possible, but downright plausible, that real estate will do better than either of these asset classes over the next decade.
Maybe the investing public is smarter than we give them credit.
Let‚Äôs start by considering bonds‚Äô prospects over the next decade. Currently the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.1%, which is just 0.3 percentage points higher than the break-even 10-year inflation rate. (The break-even rate is the difference between the yields on the nominal and inflation-protected 10-year Treasury.) So the market‚Äôs best judgment right now is that your return above inflation over the next decade will be just 0.3% annualized.
And if inflation is worse than the market currently expects, bonds will do even worse.
Next let‚Äôs consider stocks‚Äô prospects. Forecasting equity performance is much more difficult than in the case of bonds, given the far greater number of factors that can impact their returns. But you should know that, according to almost all standard valuation metrics, stocks currently are somewhere between overvalued and extremely overvalued . Furthermore, you cannot explain away this overvaluation because of low interest rates .
Given this overvaluation, it‚Äôs entirely possible that stocks will join bonds over the next decade in falling far short of their historical averages. How far short? By way of a possible answer, I refer you to the 10-year forecast compiled by Research Affiliates . They currently are projecting that the S&P 500 (including dividends) will produced an inflation-adjusted return of just 0.5% annualized over the next decade, and that long-term U.S. Treasury bonds will produce an inflation-adjusted return of minus 0.7%.
Or take the 7-year forecast from Boston-based GMO . They are projecting that the S&P 500 will produced an inflation-adjusted total return of minus 4.2% between now and 2026, with U.S. long-term Treasury bonds losing at a rate of 1.1% annualized.
These are just projections, of course, and other firms are more bullish than these two. But, at a minimum, these two firms‚Äô forecasts suggest that the respondents to the Bankrate survey aren‚Äôt necessarily as ill-informed as might otherwise appear.
Real estate during stock bear markets There‚Äôs one other factor that should be considered when deciding whether real estate or equities is the better bet for performance over the next decade: How will real estate perform during a major stock market decline? Given our all-too-fresh memories of real estate‚Äôs awful performance during the financial crisis, you may be avoiding real estate because it‚Äôs even riskier than stocks.
But real estate‚Äôs experience during the financial crisis appears to be the exception rather than the rule. In every other stock market bear market since the 1950s, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose in all but one. And in that lone bear market prior to 2007 in which the index did fall, it did so by just 0.4%. (I discussed real estate‚Äôs performance during stock bear markets in an article several years ago for Barron‚Äôs .)
Furthermore, you should know that the Case-Shiller index has been less volatile than the stock market‚Äîa lot less. As measured by the standard deviation of annual returns, in fact, the Case-Shiller index is only 40% as volatile as the overall stock market. Perceptions to the contrary that real estate is riskier than equities derive from the leverage we typically use when purchasing real estate. Note carefully that the risk comes from the leverage, not real estate inherently.
So if you were to believe there is a major stock bear market in the cards at some point in the next decade, you might choose real estate just because of its lower risk.

108,bitcoin,World's top economists make case for English majors,"World's top economists make case for English majors 21 Oct, 2019 9:43am 6 minutes to read ""You can't get a job with an English major,"" the old refrain always goes. Photo / Getty Images Washington Post Share on Reddit reddit A great migration is happening on US college campuses. Ever since the fall of 2008, a lot of students have walked out of English and humanities lectures and into STEM classes, especially computer science and engineering. English majors are down more than a quarter (25.5 per cent) since the Great Recession, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics. It's the biggest drop for any major tracked by the centre in its annual data and is quite startling, given that college enrollment has jumped in the past decade. READ MORE:‚Ä¢ The dark art of economics Ask any college student or professor why this big shift from studying Chaucer to studying coding is happening and they will probably tell you it's about jobs. As students feared for their job prospects, they - and their parents - wanted a degree that would lead to a steady paycheck after graduation. The perception is that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) is the path to employment. Majors in computer science and health fields have nearly doubled from 2009 to 2017. Engineering and math have also seen big jumps. As humanities majors slump to the lowest level in decades, calls are coming from surprising places for a revival. Some prominent economists are making the case for why it still makes a lot of sense to major (or at least take classes) in humanities alongside more technical fields. Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller's new book ""Narrative Economics"" opens with him reminiscing about an enlightening history class he took as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. He wrote that what he learned about the Great Depression was far more useful in understanding the period of economic and financial turmoil than anything he learned in his economic courses. The whole premise of Shiller's book is that stories matter. What people tell each other can have profound implications on markets - and the overall economy. Examples include the ""get rich quick"" stories about bitcoin or the ""anyone can be a homeowner"" stories that helped drive the housing bubble. ""Traditional economic approaches fail to examine the role of public beliefs in major economic events - that is, narrative,' Shiller wrote. ""Economists can best advance their science by developing and incorporating into it the art of narrative economics."" The hype around bitcoin was built on the stories people told each other. Photo / Getty Images Shiller, who is famous for predicting the dot-com crash and coming up with the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, is spending a lot of time looking at old newspaper clippings to understand what stories and terms went viral and how they influenced people to buy things - or stop buying things. When asked if he's essentially arguing for more English and history majors, Shiller said, ""I think so,"" adding: ""Compartmentalisation of intellectual life is bad."" Shiller isn't alone in wishing that there were more storytellers (and story analysers) around. Every August, some of the world's top economists gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to discuss how the economy is doing and how they should tweak their models. On the final day of events this year, Philip Lowe, head of Australia's central bank, urged his colleagues to spend a little less time on numbers and more time on being good storytellers. ""It's important we don't just talk about numbers, coefficients and rules, but stories that people can understand,"" Lowe said. ""Stories about how policies are contributing to economic welfare and the things that really matter to people."" Lowe's words struck a nerve, partly because Australia has not had a recession in more than 25 years and partly because central bankers around the room generally agreed that their communication could be better. One economist pointed out that Jamaica's central bank is employing reggae artists to explain that ""high inflation is a wicked ting."" The Federal Reserve doesn't have anything quite like that, but it is searching for a senior speechwriter who can help top central bank officials speak ""to a wide variety of audiences."" ""I am expected to be, and I am, a storyteller. I tell stories about the future,"" said Stefan Ingves, governor of Sweden's central bank. ""We human beings simply love stories about the future. That's part of my job."" Ingves reminded his colleagues that they have a big platform that allows them to talk to business leaders and the public about the economy. If they tell a convincing story that growth will continue, people are likely to say, ""Hmm, that's reasonable."" That could help keep confidence high, allowing company presidents to keep hiring and consumers to keep spending. As the global economy slows to its lowest rate in a decade, worries are high about how much longer the economy can power on. In many ways, President Donald Trump's constant attempts to call this the greatest economy of all time are an effort to tell a positive story to encourage Americans to keep spending, Shiller said, even if his claim is not based in fact. Perhaps the most powerful argument for why students (and their parents) might want to think twice about abandoning humanities is the data. The National Center for Education Statistics also keeps track of pay and unemployment rates by major. There's no denying that the typical computer science major makes more money shortly after graduation than the typical English major. Contrary to popular belief, English majors ages 25 to 29 had a lower unemployment rate in 2017 than math and computer science majors. That early STEM pay premium also fades quickly, according to research by David J. Deming and Kadeem L. Noray from Harvard. After about a decade, STEM majors start exiting their job fields as their skills are no longer the latest and greatest. In contrast, many humanities majors work their way to high-earning management positions. By middle age, average pay looks very similar across many majors. ""By age 40, the earnings of people who majored in fields like social science or history have caught up,"" wrote David Deming in a recent New York Times op-ed. In management and leadership positions, communication is key, as leading economists and central bankers have been quick to point out at this critical juncture for the world economy.

109,bitcoin,Bitcoin investor lost $24 million of crypto to SIM swap hackers - Business Insider,"FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on a PC motherboard Reuters Crypto investor Michael Terpin lost roughly 1,5oo bitcoins on January 7, 2018, after falling victim to a SIM swap attack, The Wall Street Journal reported . The bitcoin stake was worth $24 million that day, roughly three weeks after the asset hit its record high price. The incredibly precise hack involves thieves taking control of a phone number and using it to access email accounts, bank reserves, and even crypto wallets. Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories .
One crypto investor lost bitcoin worth as much as $24 million after falling victim to a new kind of hack known as SIM swapping, The Wall Street Journal reported .
Michael Terpin was hit by the attack on January 7, 2018, days after bitcoin reached its record high price. Thieves stole roughly 1,500 bitcoins by taking control of his phone number and using Google's ""Forgot password?"" feature to gain access to his email. With possession of the two personal accounts, the thieves hacked Terpin's crypto wallet, stole the digital assets and quickly sold them, according to WSJ.
Bitcoin traded between $16,969 and $15,790 per coin on January 7, 2018. The digital coin now trades at roughly $8,700.
SIM swaps involve stealing an individual's phone number and using it to gain access to numerous other accounts. Once a hacker can breach a user's email account, they can scour for proof of asset holdings and subsequently target trading apps, bank accounts, and crypto wallets.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was hit with a SIM swap attack on August 30 , allowing hackers to post racist and anti-Semitic tweets to his account.
The January SIM swap attack wasn't Terpin's first. He had been hacked in the same way seven months earlier, but didn't lose any assets then.
Following the first hack, the crypto investor added additional security measures to his AT&T account, including a six-digit PIN required for any future changes, according to WSJ. He also switched out text-message authentication for Google's authentication service.
""On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say my security protections were a 9.8 or higher. But these hackers, all they do is sit around in a basement and figure out ways of hacking people,"" Terpin told WSJ, noting he thinks employees at an AT&T authorized store gave hackers control of his phone number.
SIM swaps are incredibly precise, and the odds of randomly being hit by one are small compared to other hacks. Adding passcodes to a mobile account, using a password-management app, exploring ""forgot my password"" options, and using other forms of two-factor authentication can help protect phone numbers from SIM hackers, according to WSJ.

110,bitcoin,Facebook would leave Libra Association if US regulators don't approve it - Business Insider,"Two crossed lines that form an 'X'. It indicates a way to close an interaction, or dismiss a notification. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook would drop its plans to participate in the launch of a cryptocurrency it created if US regulators aren't willing to approve it. The social media giant has been leading the Libra Association's early discussions to launch Libra as an international digital currency. It's unclear what would happen to the Libra Association if Facebook left, but Zuckerberg said the social media company doesn't hold sway over the other 20 members. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
Facebook has been leading discussions to launch a new cryptocurrency, Libra, worldwide but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would be willing to drop its plans to participate if US regulators won't approve the project.
Libra would operate as a digital currency, providing an alternative to the US dollar and other currencies managed by foreign governments. The Libra Association would oversee the Libra cryptocurrency, a major difference from Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency without a governing body to provide oversight. The Libra Association has 21-members, including Calibra, a Facebook-owned subsidiary.
Zuckerberg testified before the Housing & Financial Services Committee in the US House of Representatives on October 23, with the discussion focusing on Facebook's involvement with the Libra Association. Committee members questioned why Facebook would want to create its own digital currency, and why the company should be trusted as it faces myriad problems with its increasingly widespread business.
When pressed by congressional representatives on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said Facebook would ultimately withdraw from the Libra Association if the cryptocurrency can't earn approval from regulators and the other members chose to move forward anyway.

Calibra executive David Marcus has been the public face of the Libra discussions so far, but Facebook has repeatedly said that it doesn't hold sway over the larger Libra Association. Marcus is a member of the Libra Association's board, which is decided by votes from its members ‚Äî the Libra Association's bylaws allow for between 5 and 19 seats.
It's unclear where Facebook's departure would leave the rest of the Libra Association, which has already shrunk in size due to recent departures. Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal were just a few of the major companies to withdraw from the Libra Association earlier this month, though those companies said they would consider rejoining at a later date. The 21-member association said it hopes to have 100 or more members when it launches.
For now, Zuckerberg and Calibra remain adamant that the Libra Association won't launch Libra until US regulators approve the cryptocurrency to be used around the world.",2019-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00,businessinsider.com,crossed|*|line|*|form|*|x|*|-pron-|*|indicate|*|way|*|close|*|interaction|*|dismiss|*|notification|*|mandel|*|ngan|*|getty_images|*|facebook_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|facebook|*|drop|*|-pron-|*|plan|*|participate|*|launch|*|cryptocurrency|*|-pron-|*|create|*|regulator|*|willing|*|approve|*|-pron-|*|social_medium|*|giant|*|lead|*|libra_association|*|early|*|discussion|*|launch|*|libra|*|international|*|digital_currency|*|-pron-|*|unclear|*|happen|*|libra_association|*|facebook|*|leave|*|zuckerberg|*|social_medium|*|company|*|hold|*|sway|*|member|*|visit_business|*|insider_homepage|*|story|*|facebook|*|lead|*|discussion|*|launch|*|new|*|cryptocurrency|*|libra|*|worldwide|*|facebook_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|company|*|willing|*|drop|*|-pron-|*|plan|*|participate|*|regulator|*|approve|*|project|*|libra|*|operate|*|digital_currency|*|provide|*|alternative|*|dollar|*|currency|*|manage|*|foreign_government|*|libra_association|*|oversee|*|libra_cryptocurrency|*|major|*|difference|*|bitcoin|*|popular|*|cryptocurrency|*|govern|*|body|*|provide|*|oversight|*|libra_association|*|include|*|calibra|*|facebook|*|subsidiary|*|zuckerberg|*|testify|*|housing|*|financial_services|*|committee|*|house|*|representatives|*|october|*|discussion|*|focus|*|facebook|*|involvement|*|libra_association|*|committee|*|member|*|question|*|facebook|*|want|*|create|*|-pron-|*|digital_currency|*|company|*|trust|*|-pron-|*|face|*|myriad|*|problem|*|-pron-|*|increasingly|*|widespread|*|business|*|press|*|congressional|*|representative|*|wednesday|*|zuckerberg|*|facebook|*|ultimately|*|withdraw|*|libra_association|*|cryptocurrency|*|earn|*|approval|*|regulator|*|member|*|choose|*|forward|*|read|*|lawmaker|*|grill|*|zuckerberg|*|big|*|plan|*|facebook|*|create|*|upend|*|way|*|-pron-|*|send_money|*|globe|*|calibra|*|executive|*|david_marcus|*|public|*|face|*|libra|*|discussion|*|far|*|facebook|*|repeatedly|*|-pron-|*|hold|*|sway|*|large|*|libra_association|*|marcus|*|member|*|libra_association|*|board|*|decide|*|vote|*|-pron-|*|member|*|libra_association|*|bylaw|*|allow|*|seat|*|-pron-|*|unclear|*|facebook|*|departure|*|leave|*|rest|*|libra_association|*|shrink|*|size|*|recent|*|departure|*|visa|*|mastercard|*|paypal|*|major|*|company|*|withdraw|*|libra_association|*|early|*|month|*|company|*|-pron-|*|consider|*|rejoin|*|later|*|date|*|association|*|-pron-|*|hope|*|member|*|-pron-|*|launch|*|zuckerberg|*|calibra|*|remain|*|adamant|*|libra_association|*|launch|*|libra|*|regulator|*|approve|*|cryptocurrency|*|use|*|world
111,bitcoin,"Using Cell Phone Numbers As A Secondary ID Can Pose Security Risks, Experts Say : NPR","
After regaining control of his number, Gregg Bennett says he received this automatic text message from the AT&T store in Boston that he believes was used by the SIM-swappers. Martin Kaste/Gregg Bennett hide caption toggle caption Martin Kaste/Gregg Bennett After regaining control of his number, Gregg Bennett says he received this automatic text message from the AT&T store in Boston that he believes was used by the SIM-swappers. Martin Kaste/Gregg Bennett
Gregg Bennett is an entrepreneur in Bellevue, Wash., and he knows a bit about tech. So when his smart phone started acting funny one day last April, he got a bad feeling.
""I was having trouble getting into my email account. And all of a sudden my phone went dead,"" he says. ""I look at my phone and there's no signal. And I go, 'Oh no, something's happened here.'""
It was a SIM-swap ‚Äî a ""social engineering"" trick fraudsters use to take control of somebody else's phone number. There are a couple of ways to do this. Sometimes they'll fool the phone company into believing they're the number's rightful owner, who lost the phone and needs to transfer service to a new device. And sometimes it's an inside job, with phone company staffers helping to make the switch, as alleged by federal prosecutors in a case this spring . After Equifax Hack, Calls For Big Changes In Credit Reporting Industry
Once scammers control your number, they can get your text messages ‚Äî including the verification codes many online services send when customers reset their passwords.
These are different from verification codes generated by two-factor apps or hardware keys, which are more secure because they don't depend on a phone number. But companies often use the text-message version because it's simple to use.
Bennett says the scammers used text-message verification codes to get into his email accounts, and from there it was open season.
""They got into my Amazon account, my Evernote account, my Starbucks account ‚Äî they were kind of messing with me,"" he says, with a rueful laugh.
The big prize was his Bitcoin account. It's not clear exactly how they used his phone number to log in, but once they did, he says they stole 100 Bitcoin. At the time that was the equivalent of about half a million dollars, gone in minutes. Enlarge this image

And that's what's new here. SIM-swapping has been around for years, but there's never been so much at stake.
""Phone numbers have suddenly become valuable,"" says Allison Nixon, director of security research at Flashpoint, a company that tracks cyber crime. She says phone numbers have become an irresistible target for scammers because so many companies now use the numbers to help confirm customers' identities.
""Financials, health care, social media, email ‚Äî all of these different companies, by policy, require a phone number from you. And that's what creates the vulnerability,"" Nixon says.
Here's what you can do to protect yourself from a SIM card swap attack: Don't reply to calls, emails, or text messages that request personal information. These could be phishing attempts by scammers looking to get personal information to access your cellular, bank, credit or other accounts. If you get a request for your account or personal information, contact the company using a phone number or website you know is real. Limit the personal information you share online. If possible, avoid posting your full name, address, or phone number on public sites. An identity thief could find that information and use it to answer the security questions required to verify your identity and log in to your accounts. Set up a PIN or password on your cellular account. This could help protect your account from unauthorized changes. Check your provider's website for information on how to do this. Consider using stronger authentication on accounts with sensitive personal or financial information. If you do use MFA , keep in mind that text message verification may not stop a SIM card swap. If you're concerned about SIM card swapping, use an authentication app or a security key.
As scams go, SIM-swapping is labor-intensive. Thieves research their victims, looking for rich targets... such as the crypto-currency investor in California who says he lost $24 Million dollars to SIM-swappers last year. He's now suing AT&T over the loss .
But Nixon says SIM-swapper are broadening their aim.
""Eventually you're going to run out of rich people, right? And you've got to start targeting middle-class people, upper-middle class people,"" Nixon says. ""I know people that have been SIM-swapped that have no clear indication as to why, aside from the fact that they get paid and they have a retirement account.""
Experts have floated various ideas for improving security ‚Äî for instance, carriers might require that any phone number transfers happen in person, at a store; carriers could also build a 24-hour waiting period into any number transfer.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, has been looking at what the phone companies could do. He won't get into details about behind-the-scenes discussions, but he's not optimistic.
""The industry is not exactly exerting itself in order to better protect consumers from these SIM-swap scams,"" he says.
The wireless companies refer questions about SIM-swapping to their industry association, the CTIA ‚Äî but the association wouldn't do an interview with NPR. It pointed instead to a blog post with tips for avoiding sim-swaps.
Allison Nixon says phone companies have made progress in recent months, closing technical vulnerabilities that have been exploited by SIM-swappers. But she says the human element ‚Äî gullible or corruptible staffers ‚Äî remains a problem.
Still, she says she can understand why phone companies might be hesitant to erect higher security barriers for number-transfers.
""It would make the purchase process for the average legitimate customer a little more difficult, a little bit slower, and multiply that by however many millions of sales they make, it probably adds up to a decent amount of money,"" she says.
Another solution might be to try to wean Americans from their reliance on phones numbers for authentication. Federal regulators have noted the vulnerabilities of text-message codes, compared to more secure methods such as two-factor authentication apps. But the wireless industry is pushing back. In a letter to the FTC in August , the industry defended text-message two-factor as, quote, ""easily accessible and trusted."" Town Avoids Paying Massive $5 Million Ransom In Cyberattack
But they're no longer trusted by Gregg Bennett. ""People who are using phones as their only source of two-factor identification are inviting identity theft,"" Bennett warns.
He now uses authentication apps, such as Google Authenticator, or a hardware key. When companies force him to use text-message codes, he uses a second phone number, which he takes care not to share in places where scammers might find it.
He's currently in arbitration with AT&T, which wouldn't talk about his case to NPR. He says the company is stonewalling on details of how he got SIM-swapped, but he suspects he was victimized by somebody on the East Coast.
""When I finally recovered my phone,"" he says, ""I got a text message asking how my service was at the AT&T store in Boston.""

112,bitcoin,Police warn of scam where suspects impersonate officers | CTV News,"Scammers have defrauded Canadians out of tens of millions of dollars over the past decade pretending to be collecting back taxes with the Canada Revenue Agency‚Äîbut police are warning of a new twist on the old scam.
The scammers are pretending to be officers with local police forces, investigators said.
The thieves are also using caller ID spoofing so it looks like the call is coming from a police phone number.
Toronto police Const. David Hopkinson said that officers do not collect taxes on behalf of the government.
‚ÄúThe Toronto Police isn't involved with the Canada Revenue Agency with regards to the collection of money and the Canada Revenue Agency does not collect money in this fashion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust because it says police there are ways to change the identification on the phone to say police.‚Äù
In the past few weeks, Toronto police say one victim gave the scammers $1,200 using a Bitcoin machine after he was told he would be deported if he didn‚Äôt pay. A woman was told her Social Insurance Number was being used for fraudulent activity and she must immediately pay $1,000 or she would be arrested. She also paid in Bitcoin.
The Canada Revenue Agency will never call and use nasty language or threaten a customer. They will also never ask for credit card information, personal information by email or text, or request your social insurance number or ask for bank account information.
If you get a call that seems suspicious, do not engage the caller and just hang up.
‚ÄúWe need to get the message out so people aren't giving up their money to scammers on the phone,"" Hopkinson said.

114,bitcoin,The crypto CEO who bailed on a $4.6 million lunch with Warren Buffett struck a deal with Samsung to reach ‚Äòbillions of customers‚Äô,"View Business Insider‚Äôs homepage for more stories . The crypto whiz kid who bailed on a $4.6 million lunch with Warren Buffett has struck a deal with Samsung to reach ‚Äúbillions of customers.‚Äù Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun, who invited Donald Trump and a slew of crypto bosses to attend his charity meal with Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs billionaire CEO but postponed at the last minute, announced the integration of his company‚Äôs cryptocurrency with the Samsung Blockchain Keystore last week. The collaboration enables users of newer Samsung phones such as the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 to store Tron‚Äôs TRX tokens on their devices and use them to buy apps built on the Tron network and make in-app purchases. It also means app developers can make Tron apps on Samsung devices. Tron is the world‚Äôs 11th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Sun, a prot√©g√© of Alibaba founder Jack Ma , teased the tie-up on Twitter after Samsung added him to the list of speakers at its developer conference at the end of October.

115,bitcoin,More Than 300 Arrested In Child Porn Site Bust : NPR,"World 'One Of The Worst Forms Of Evil': More Than 330 Arrested In Child Porn Site Bust Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email October 16, 2019 3:51 PM ET Merrit Kennedy

toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP The Department of Justice announced that hundreds of people have been charged in the takedown of a massive darknet child pornography website.
Jose Luis Magana/AP More than 330 people have been arrested around the world in a major takedown of a massive child pornography website, which U.S. officials say is among the first to be found using cryptocurrency to carry out video sales.
""These agents and prosecutors rescued some 23 children worldwide from abusive situations,"" in the U.S., Spain and the U.K., said Jessie Liu, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. She described this type of crime as ""one of the worst forms of evil imaginable.""
""Our message for those who produce, distribute, and receive child pornography is clear: You may try to hide behind technology but we will find you and we will arrest and prosecute you,"" Liu added.
At a news conference on Wednesday, federal officials said they seized 8 terabytes of child sexual exploitation videos.
Europe German Couple Convicted Of Selling Child On The Darknet ""That's more than 10,000 CD-ROMs full of imagery that's no longer in the hands of child pornographers,"" said Don Fort, chief of IRS Criminal Investigation.
The porn site, called Welcome to Video, accepted payment in bitcoin and was on the Tor network, which is encrypted and hidden. The site's upload page explicitly asked users not to upload ""adult porn."" It operated for nearly three years before it was shut down in March of 2018.
Investigators targeted hundreds of the sites' users. Among them was Michael Lawson, a father of two young children from Midland, Ga. He is currently serving 121 months in prison and was deemed an ""extreme danger"" to his community, said Richard Downing, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Criminal Division.
""He admitted to engaging in child sexual exploitation and purchasing and downloading images and videos with bitcoin from his home,"" Downing said. ""He installed cameras in his residence and captured video of prepubescent friends of his children using the bathroom and showers.""
The Two-Way Justice Department Announces 'Largest Darknet Takedown In History' Authorities say a 23-year-old South Korean national, Jong Woo Son, operated the child pornography website. He is currently serving a prison sentence in South Korea. A U.S. grand jury has also charged Jong in a nine-count indictment that was unsealed Wednesday.
According to Jong's indictment, the child porn site took in more than $370,000 worth of bitcoin during the time it was operating. Liu said authorities are trying to recover the profits, so the money could be distributed to the victims.
The case stemmed from an investigation that started in August 2017 into illicit transactions using cryptocurrency on the darknet, Downing told reporters. ""By following the funds on a blockchain, it ultimately uncovered the severity of Welcome to Video,"" he added.
And IRS special agents were able to trace the transactions to the physical location of the server in South Korea, Fort stated. Authorities used software from the company Chainalysis ""to analyze blockchain transations and map out contributors and users of the site,"" according to the company .
""We want to enable an entire economy powered by cryptocurrency, but sites like WTV destroy the public's faith in the technology and slow down adoption in the legitimate economy,"" Chainalysis said in a statement, adding that it seeks to build trust in blockchains.
The Department of Justice say the child porn website ""is among the first of its kind to monetize child exploitation videos using bitcoin"" ‚Äî it's more typical for sites to simply provide a way for users to trade these horrifying images with each other.
Data seized from the server is still being analyzed. And U.S. authorities are trying to use the videos, many of which they haven't seen before, to find more child victims. They've notified 38 other countries of leads that were uncovered from the data.
Law enforcement agencies have arrested and charged 337 site users so far, across the U.S. and in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Brazil and Australia.

116,bitcoin,DOJ arrests hundreds in global cryptocurrency child pornography website bust,"T he founder of the world‚Äôs largest online child pornography website, which utilized the darknet and cryptocurrency in its criminal operations, has been arrested, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.
Jong Woo Son, 23, the administrator of the child porn website Welcome To Video, was arrested in March 2018, and the DOJ said it spent a year and a half following his arrest investigating the site‚Äôs users and shutting down its online operations.
The South Korean was arrested along with 337 website users in the United States and globally by a joint operation including U.S., British, and South Korean authorities.
Authorities seized the website's server with approximately eight terabytes of child sexual exploitation videos, making it ‚Äúone of the largest seizures of its kind.‚Äù The server showed the website, partially concealed on hidden online networks known as the darknet, had more than a million bitcoin addresses, which signified that it could have that many users.
Welcome To Video was among the first where users could buy child exploitation videos using the virtual cryptocurrency bitcoin, authorities said. The site‚Äôs upload page stated ‚ÄúDo not upload adult porn‚Äù with the last two words bolded, and DOJ said the website ‚Äúboasted over one million downloads of child exploitation videos by users.‚Äù
The files seized from the child porn website contained over 250,000 unique videos, nearly half of which so far had not been previously known to exist, and the images are still being analyzed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Some of the images are described in the criminal complaint and are graphic, violent, abusive, and disturbing.
DOJ said its investigation resulted in criminal referral leads sent to 38 countries, and at least 23 minor victims in the U.S., Spain, and the United Kingdom ‚Äúwho were being actively abused by the users of the site‚Äù were rescued because of the operation.
A forfeiture complaint against 24 cryptocurrency accounts used in connection to the child porn website was also unsealed Wednesday. DOJ said the virtual currency accounts were allegedly used by 24 people in five countries ‚Äúto fund the website and promote the exploitation of children.‚Äù
The more than 300 people arrested ‚Äî who gained access to the website either by uploading child pornography, referring new users to the site, or paying for access using bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrency ‚Äî were from two dozen states in the U.S., as well as from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the U.K.
DOJ searched the homes and businesses of 92 people in the U.S. tied to this child exploitation scheme. In just the Washington, D.C., area alone, DOJ said five search warrants were executed, and eight people who conspired with the website‚Äôs administrator and used the site themselves were arrested and that two users of the website died by suicide after these searches were carried out.",2019-10-16T21:51:00.000+03:00,washingtonexaminer.com,t|*|-pron-|*|founder|*|world_large|*|online|*|child_pornography|*|website|*|utilize|*|darknet|*|cryptocurrency|*|-pron-|*|criminal|*|operation|*|arrest|*|justice_department|*|announce|*|wednesday|*|jong|*|woo|*|son|*|administrator|*|child_porn|*|website|*|welcome|*|video|*|arrest|*|march|*|doj|*|-pron-|*|spend|*|year|*|half|*|follow|*|-pron-|*|arrest|*|investigate|*|site|*|user|*|shut|*|-pron-|*|online|*|operation|*|south|*|korean|*|arrest|*|website|*|user|*|united_states|*|globally|*|joint|*|operation|*|include|*|british|*|south|*|korean|*|authority|*|authority|*|seize|*|website|*|server|*|approximately|*|terabyte|*|child|*|sexual|*|exploitation|*|video|*|-pron-|*|large|*|seizure|*|-pron-|*|kind|*|server|*|website|*|partially|*|conceal|*|hide|*|online|*|network|*|know|*|darknet|*|million|*|bitcoin|*|address|*|signify|*|-pron-|*|user|*|welcome|*|video|*|user|*|buy|*|child|*|exploitation|*|video|*|use|*|virtual|*|cryptocurrency|*|bitcoin|*|authority|*|site|*|upload|*|page|*|state|*|upload|*|adult|*|porn|*|word|*|bolde|*|doj|*|website|*|boast|*|million|*|download|*|child|*|exploitation|*|video|*|user|*|file|*|seize|*|child_porn|*|website|*|contain|*|unique|*|video|*|nearly|*|half|*|far|*|previously|*|know|*|exist|*|image|*|analyze|*|national|*|center|*|miss|*|exploit|*|child|*|image|*|describe|*|criminal|*|complaint|*|graphic|*|violent|*|abusive|*|disturbing|*|doj|*|-pron-|*|investigation|*|result|*|criminal|*|referral|*|lead|*|send|*|country|*|minor|*|victim|*|spain|*|united_kingdom|*|actively|*|abuse|*|user|*|site|*|rescue|*|operation|*|forfeiture|*|complaint|*|cryptocurrency|*|account|*|use|*|connection|*|child_porn|*|website|*|unseal|*|wednesday|*|doj|*|virtual|*|currency|*|account|*|allegedly|*|use|*|people|*|country|*|fund|*|website|*|promote|*|exploitation|*|child|*|people|*|arrest|*|gain|*|access|*|website|*|upload|*|child_pornography|*|refer|*|new|*|user|*|site|*|pay|*|access|*|use|*|bitcoin|*|form|*|cryptocurrency|*|dozen|*|state|*|australia|*|brazil|*|canada|*|czech|*|republic|*|germany|*|ireland|*|saudi|*|arabia|*|south_korea|*|spain|*|united|*|arab|*|emirates|*|doj|*|search|*|home|*|business|*|people|*|tie|*|child|*|exploitation|*|scheme|*|washington|*|area|*|doj|*|search|*|warrant|*|execute|*|people|*|conspire|*|website|*|administrator|*|use|*|site|*|-pron-|*|arrest|*|user|*|website|*|die|*|suicide|*|search|*|carry
117,bitcoin,Bitcoin price hits lowest since June on Zuckerberg Libra hearing - Business Insider,"
Bitcoin slipped to its lowest level since June on Wednesday as Mark Zuckerberg began his planned testimonial in front of the House Financial Services Committee. The Facebook CEO will discuss the company's planned cryptocurrency, Libra.
The world's largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 9% to $7,418 in New York.
Lawmakers and critics have expressed concern about Facebook's involvement in the financial system for a number of reasons: The blunders it has made when handling the personal data of its social network's members in the past Its sheer size and scale, which lawmakers worry could enable Libra to grow too quickly to properly manage The potential risk for the system being used by criminals or to finance terrorism
Zuckerberg is expected to be asked about these items during his testimony.
""The main reason for this is because of the immense pressure Facebook's Libra is getting from Washington,"" Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co told Bloomberg . ""That is basically making it much less likely that Bitcoin will go mainstream as quickly as some of its bulls think it will.""
Several early partners for Libra have already dropped out of the project including major players like Visa and Mastercard, and eBay, after major scrutiny of the project from US lawmakers.
Other cryptocurrencies also felt the heat of Zuckerberg's testimonial as Ethereum fell as much as 10%.

118,bitcoin,"Now, California Can Assess Taxes No Matter Where You Live...Really","If you live in California, you probably know how aggressive California‚Äôs state tax agency can be. In fact, even if you live somewhere else, you might have heard of the Golden State‚Äôs aggressive tax rules. Buy a vacation home in California, and stay a little too long? Come into the state and do some work for your non-California employer? Travel to California trying to sell some products or collect data that you‚Äôll use out of state when you get back home? null
Getty Any of these things and many others can pique the interest of California‚Äôs tax collection agency, the Franchise Tax Board. In fact, it can feel like just about any connection to California can be enough to at least raise tax issues. Of course, being a California resident and then moving away has its own set of tax issues. The thought of leaving California over taxes is nothing new . California's tough Franchise Tax Board (FTB) polices the line between residents and non-residents , and does so rigorously. If you leave, California is likely to probe how and when you stopped being a resident. For that reason, even if you think your facts are not controversial, be careful. California is known to chase people who leave, and to disagree about whether they really are non-residents. After all, California's 13.3% tax on capital gains inspires plenty of tax moves.
Even where California agrees that you moved, they might not agree when you moved. Say you move from California to Texas and then sell your appreciated stock or bitcoin. California might agree that you moved, but might say you didn‚Äôt actually establish residency in Texas and depart California for tax purposes until several months later. That might be enough to make all your sales California source income. It can make you wonder whether California will ‚Äòlet‚Äô you move states! Some people seek to avoid California taxes with trusts .
The state‚Äôs Franchise Tax Board is the state income tax collector, and it has a fearsome reputation. Most tax lawyers will tell you that they would much rather fight the IRS than California‚Äôs FTB any day of the week. Savvy taxpayers know this too. You can skate for much longer with IRS problems, and you can more easily defeat or compromise IRS bills. But can you truly be outside of California and still face California taxes? A recent decision says you can.
Now, check out California Office of Tax Appeals decision In the Matter of Blair S. Bindley , OTA Case No. 18032402 (May 30, 2019). There, a nonresident sole proprietor performed all of his services outside of California. However, some of his customers were located in California. Is that enough for the poor guy to attract California tax liability? The California taxing authorities said he was operating a ""unitary"" business. Therefore, his tiny business was subject to California's apportionment rules. The state‚Äôs Office of Tax Appeals said this case has precedential effect, so it is clear the Golden State can go after other non-Californians too.
Exactly what was poor Mr. Bindley‚Äôs tax offense in California? He is a self-employed screenplay writer living in Arizona. He performed services for a few companies headquartered and registered in California. The California Franchise Tax Board matched income records showing that he collected $40,000 of income from California companies. Not surprisingly, Bindley did not file a California tax return. That meant California‚Äôs statute of limitations would never start to run. That itself is a useful lesson. The statute of limitations is a reason that many non-residents of California file a return to report a small amount of California source income.
In Bindley‚Äôs case, the state noted that whether a nonresident is subject to California's rules for apportioning income depends on : (1) whether the taxpayer is carrying on a trade or business within California, outside of California, or a combination thereof; (2) the type of entity conducting the business; and (3) whether the business is unitary. California ruled that Bindley‚Äôs screenwriting business was carried on inside and outside of California. He worked as a proprietor, and basically did the same kind of work for non-California and for California companies. That‚Äôs a useful lesson too. What exactly is unitary anyway?
California‚Äôs tough tax regulations only describe what is not a unitary business. California says that a business is not unitary where the part within the state is so separate and distinct from (and unconnected to) the part outside the state that the businesses are not a unitary business. Here, the Golden State said that this screenwriter ran a unitary operation. After all, the part conducted inside California and the part conducted outside the state were not separate and distinct so as to be separate businesses.
If your business is unitary, the income derived from services is sourced to the place where the benefit of the service is received. To determine the place where the benefit of the service is received, California law provides rules looking first to the contract. If the contract does not specify the location where the benefit is received, then California or the taxpayer can try to approximate the location where the benefit is received. For the companies located in California that paid the screenwriter, California said it was reasonable to conclude that the companies received the benefit of the services in California.
Does this screenwriter‚Äôs unfortunate tax flap mean other little businesses that happen to sell into in California could face tax troubles? Yes, it sure seems that way. California can now push even on sole proprietors who might have California customers. They might have to file California returns and pay California taxes. This is so even if all the services are performed outside of California, and even if the sole proprietor has no connection to California.",2019-10-22T15:56:00.000+03:00,forbes.com,-pron-|*|live|*|california|*|-pron-|*|probably|*|know|*|aggressive|*|california|*|state|*|tax|*|agency|*|fact|*|-pron-|*|live|*|-pron-|*|hear|*|golden|*|state|*|aggressive|*|tax|*|rule|*|buy|*|vacation|*|home|*|california|*|stay|*|little|*|long|*|come|*|state|*|work|*|-pron-|*|non|*|california|*|employer|*|travel|*|california|*|try|*|sell|*|product|*|collect|*|datum|*|-pron-|*|use|*|state|*|-pron-|*|home|*|null|*|getty|*|thing|*|pique|*|interest|*|california|*|tax|*|collection|*|agency|*|franchise|*|tax|*|board|*|fact|*|-pron-|*|feel|*|like|*|connection|*|california|*|raise|*|tax|*|issue|*|course|*|california|*|resident|*|away|*|-pron-|*|set|*|tax|*|issue|*|thought|*|leave|*|california|*|taxis|*|new|*|california|*|tough|*|franchise|*|tax|*|board|*|ftb|*|police|*|line|*|resident|*|non|*|resident|*|rigorously|*|-pron-|*|leave|*|california|*|likely|*|probe|*|-pron-|*|stop|*|resident|*|reason|*|-pron-|*|think|*|-pron-|*|fact|*|controversial|*|careful|*|california|*|know|*|chase|*|people|*|leave|*|disagree|*|-pron-|*|non|*|resident|*|california|*|tax|*|capital|*|gain|*|inspire|*|plenty|*|tax|*|california|*|agree|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|agree|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|california|*|texas|*|sell|*|-pron-|*|appreciate|*|stock|*|bitcoin|*|california|*|agree|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|actually|*|establish|*|residency|*|texas|*|depart|*|california|*|tax|*|purpose|*|month|*|later|*|-pron-|*|sale|*|california|*|source|*|income|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|wonder|*|california|*|let|*|-pron-|*|state|*|people|*|seek|*|avoid|*|california|*|taxis|*|trust|*|state|*|franchise|*|tax|*|board|*|state|*|income|*|tax|*|collector|*|-pron-|*|fearsome|*|reputation|*|tax|*|lawyer|*|tell|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|fight|*|irs|*|california|*|ftb|*|day|*|week|*|savvy|*|taxpayer|*|know|*|-pron-|*|skate|*|long|*|irs|*|problem|*|-pron-|*|easily|*|defeat|*|compromise|*|irs|*|bill|*|-pron-|*|truly|*|outside|*|california|*|face|*|california|*|taxis|*|recent|*|decision|*|-pron-|*|check|*|california|*|office|*|tax|*|appeals|*|decision|*|matter|*|blair|*|bindley|*|ota|*|case|*|nonresident|*|sole|*|proprietor|*|perform|*|-pron-|*|service|*|outside|*|california|*|-pron-|*|customer|*|locate|*|california|*|poor|*|guy|*|attract|*|california|*|tax|*|liability|*|california|*|taxing|*|authority|*|-pron-|*|operate|*|unitary|*|business|*|-pron-|*|tiny|*|business|*|subject|*|california|*|apportionment|*|rule|*|state|*|office|*|tax|*|appeals|*|case|*|precedential|*|effect|*|-pron-|*|clear|*|golden|*|state|*|non|*|californians|*|exactly|*|poor|*|bindley|*|tax|*|offense|*|california|*|-pron-|*|self|*|employ|*|screenplay|*|writer|*|live|*|arizona|*|-pron-|*|perform|*|service|*|company|*|headquarter|*|register|*|california|*|california|*|franchise|*|tax|*|board|*|match|*|income|*|record|*|-pron-|*|collect|*|income|*|california|*|company|*|surprisingly|*|bindley|*|file|*|california|*|tax|*|return|*|mean|*|california|*|statute|*|limitation|*|start|*|run|*|-pron-|*|useful|*|lesson|*|statute|*|limitation|*|reason|*|non|*|resident|*|california|*|file|*|return|*|report|*|small|*|california|*|source|*|income|*|bindley|*|case|*|state|*|note|*|nonresident|*|subject|*|california|*|rule|*|apportion|*|income|*|depend|*|taxpayer|*|carry|*|trade|*|business|*|california|*|outside|*|california|*|combination|*|thereof|*|type|*|entity|*|conduct|*|business|*|business|*|unitary|*|california|*|rule|*|bindley|*|screenwriting|*|business|*|carry|*|inside|*|outside|*|california|*|-pron-|*|work|*|proprietor|*|basically|*|kind|*|work|*|non|*|california|*|california|*|company|*|useful|*|lesson|*|exactly|*|unitary|*|california|*|tough|*|tax|*|regulation|*|describe|*|unitary|*|business|*|california|*|business|*|unitary|*|state|*|separate|*|distinct|*|unconnected|*|outside|*|state|*|business|*|unitary|*|business|*|golden|*|state|*|screenwriter|*|run|*|unitary|*|operation|*|conduct|*|inside|*|california|*|conduct|*|outside|*|state|*|separate|*|distinct|*|separate|*|business|*|-pron-|*|business|*|unitary|*|income|*|derive|*|service|*|source|*|place|*|benefit|*|service|*|receive|*|determine|*|place|*|benefit|*|service|*|receive|*|california|*|law|*|provide|*|rule|*|look|*|contract|*|contract|*|specify|*|location|*|benefit|*|receive|*|california|*|taxpayer|*|try|*|approximate|*|location|*|benefit|*|receive|*|company|*|locate|*|california|*|pay|*|screenwriter|*|california|*|-pron-|*|reasonable|*|conclude|*|company|*|receive|*|benefit|*|service|*|california|*|screenwriter|*|unfortunate|*|tax|*|flap|*|mean|*|little|*|business|*|happen|*|sell|*|california|*|face|*|tax|*|trouble|*|yes|*|-pron-|*|sure|*|way|*|california|*|push|*|sole|*|proprietor|*|california|*|customer|*|-pron-|*|file|*|california|*|return|*|pay|*|california|*|taxis|*|service|*|perform|*|outside|*|california|*|sole|*|proprietor|*|connection|*|california
119,bitcoin,JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon says Facebook cryptocurrency Libra won't happen - Business Insider,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon dinged Facebook&apos;s cryptocurrency Libra, saying it was a ""neat idea"" that won&apos;t happen. Facebook announced the currency in June, with the idea that people all over the world could use it to pay for services online. But regulators and prospective partners are suspicious, fearing that the currency could be used for criminal purposes and that it jeopardizes financial stability. Dimon didn&apos;t elaborate, but he&apos;s previously expressed skepticism about digital currencies, once describing bitcoin as a fraud. Visit Business Insider&apos;s homepage for more stories . Facebook&apos;s uphill struggle with its cryptocurrency Libra just got a little steeper, after the CEO of one of the world&apos;s biggest banks said the currency ""will never happen.""
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon dinged the currency at a conference by the Institute of International Finance in Washington, saying: ""It was a neat idea that&apos;ll never happen.""
We saw the news of Dimon&apos;s remarks via Bloomberg .
Dimon didn&apos;t elaborate much further, but added: ""We already have stablecoins, so they&apos;re not the first to do that.""
A stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to an existing currency, like the dollar. Libra is intended to be pegged to a basket of currencies including the dollar, the euro, and the yen.
Dimon&apos;s remarks come after a rough two weeks for Facebook&apos;s Libra.
Read more: Facebook&apos;s Libra cryptocurrency plan just got formalized, but a quarter of its backers have now dropped out
The firm announced Libra in June, along with a coalition of 28 initial backers who would help govern the currency and get it off the ground, expected to be the end of 2020.
Through October, a quarter of those backers dropped out, including Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and PayPal, leaving Facebook with no major payment partners. The remaining 21 partners, including Spotify, Uber, and Lyft, confirmed their commitment to the currency in mid-October.
But politicians and regulators remain suspicious. The G7 group of wealthy nations said this month that stablecoins shouldn&apos;t be permitted to launch until they properly address all the financial risks. The worry is that new currencies might be funnelled into funding terrorist or criminal activity. And France has said that it will block Libra from operating in Europe.
A Libra executive also recently suggested that the currency won&apos;t be ready to launch by the end of 2020, as originally planned.
Facebook&apos;s Libra chief David Marcus has scrambled both to defend the currency , and to emphasise that it will be overseen by all its partners and not just Facebook.
Dimon has long been a cryptocurrency skeptic. He famously described bitcoin as ""a fraud"", though he then said he regretted making those comments. He later said he believes in the technology that underpins bitcoin, the blockchain, and JPMorgan in February became the first US bank to launch its own cryptocurrency .

120,bitcoin,MSM Adamantly Avoids The Word ‚ÄúCoup‚Äù In Bolivia Reporting,"Nov 11 ¬∑5 min read There has been a military coup in Bolivia backed by violent right-wing rioters and the US government , but you‚Äôd hardly know this from any of the mainstream media headlines. ‚ÄúBolivian President Evo Morales steps down following accusations of election fraud‚Äù proclaims CNN. ‚ÄúBolivia‚Äôs Morales resigns amid scathing election report, rising protests‚Äù reports The Washington Post . ‚ÄúBolivian Leader Evo Morales Steps Down‚Äù says The New York Times . ‚ÄúBolivian President Evo Morales resigns amid fraud poll protests‚Äù declares the BBC. ‚ÄúPresident of Bolivia steps down amid allegations of election rigging‚Äù we are informed by Telegraph . ‚ÄúBolivia‚Äôs President Morales resigns after backlash to disputed election‚Äù says the Sydney Morning Herald. So there you have it. The indigenous leader of a socialist South American government which has successfully lifted masses of people out of crushing poverty , which happens to control the world‚Äôs largest reserves of lithium (which may one day replace oil as a crucial energy resource due to its use in powering smartphones, laptops, hybrid and electric cars), which has an extensive and well-documented history of being targeted for regime change by the US government , simply stepped down due to some sort of scandal involving a ‚Äúdisputed election‚Äù. Nothing to do with the fact that right-wing mobs had been terrorizing this leader‚Äôs family , or the fact that the nation‚Äôs military literally commanded him to step down and are now currently searching for him to arrest him , leading to ousted government officials being rounded up and held captive by soldiers wearing masks . All perfectly normal and not suspicious at all. As is usual , mass media‚Äôs reporting on this story is in full alignment with the US State Department, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also advancing the ‚Äúdisputed election‚Äù line in a tweet shortly before the forced resignation of Morales. Pompeo cited the evidence-free and discredited allegation of suspicious vote tallies during Morales‚Äô re-election last month from the Washington-based Organization of American States (OAS). As Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic & Policy Research explains in a recent article for The Nation , the OAS receives 60 percent of its funding from Washington, which gives the US tremendous leverage over the supposedly neutral and international body. This ties in interestingly with what we discussed the other day about Washington‚Äôs known history of using its disproportionate financial support for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as leverage to force that supposedly neutral and international body to comply with US agendas. The field of narrative management keeps making more and more advances. The US-centralized empire just keeps throwing coup attempts at unabsorbed governments until they stick. The coup in Venezuela failed in 2002 and again in 2019, but they‚Äôll just keep attempting them until one takes hold. A kickboxer throws strikes in combinations with the understanding that most attacks will miss or do minimal damage against a trained opponent, but eventually one will get through and score the knockout blow. Imperialist regime change agendas employ the same punches-in-bunches philosophy: just keep attacking and undermining at every possible turn, and eventually something will stick. And the empire can afford to do this. When you have all the power and resources, you can bide your time, knowing that if the current attempt at toppling the government in a sovereign nation fails, there‚Äôs always tomorrow. At a United Nations Security Council meeting last year, President Morales summed up the true nature of America‚Äôs role in the world very accurately, and, it turns out, very presciently. ‚ÄúI would like to say to you, frankly and openly here, that in no way is the United States interested in upholding democracy,‚Äù Morales said. ‚ÄúIf such were the case it would not have financed coups d‚Äôetat and supported dictators. It would not have threatened with military intervention democratically elected governments as it has done with Venezuela. The United States could not care less about human rights or justice. If this were the case, it would have signed the international conventions and treaties that have protected human rights.It would not have threatened the investigation mechanism of the International Criminal Court, nor would it promote the use of torture, nor would it have walked away from the Human Rights Council. And nor would it have separated migrant children from their families, nor put them in cages.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe United States is not interested in multilateralism,‚Äù Morales continued. ‚ÄúIf it were interested in multilateralism it would not have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement or given the cold shoulder to the global compact on migration, it would not have launched unilateral attacks, nor have taken decisions such as illegally declaring Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel. This contempt for multilateralism is motivated by the thirst of the United States for political control and for the seizing of natural resources.‚Äù ‚ÄúEach time that the United States invades nations, launches missiles, or finances regime change, it does so behind a propaganda campaign which incessantly repeats the message that it is acting in the course of justice, freedom and democracy, in the cause of human rights or for humanitarian reasons,‚Äù Morales also said. ‚ÄúThe responsibility of our generation is to hand over a fairer and more secure world to the following generation,‚Äù Morales concluded. ‚ÄúWe will only achieve this dream if we work together to consolidate a multipolar world, a world with common rules that are respected by and defended from all the threats ranged against the United Nations.‚Äù Indeed, the only reason the US is able to wage its endless campaign of regime change agendas against unabsorbed governments is because the unipolar world order it rules has allowed it the power, resources and leisure to do so. A multipolar world would enable the citizenry of this planet to have a say in what happens to them in a way that is not dictated by a few sociopaths in and around Washington, DC. A multipolar world is to democracy as a unipolar world is to monarchy. The citizens of the world should oppose this unipolarity. Thanks for reading!

121,bitcoin,Quant traders train their algorithms to invest like Warren Buffett - Business Insider,"Foto: Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. A team of quantitative traders in London are training their algorithms to invest like Warren Buffett. Unlike many algorithmic trading funds that constantly buy and sell assets, Havelock London aims to identify undervalued businesses and invest for the long term, according to the Financial Times . ‚ÄúTraditionally, quants are a mile wide and an inch deep,‚Äù founder and CEO Matthew Beddall told the newspaper. ‚ÄúWe try to be a mile deep and an inch wide.‚Äù Visit Business Insider‚Äôs homepage for more stories . A team of quantitative traders in London are training their algorithms to invest like Warren Buffett. Algorithmic trading typically involves constantly buying and selling assets. Havelock London, which operates out of a basement office sandwiched between a pub and a Chinese restaurant, wants to buck that trend. ‚ÄúTraditionally, quants are a mile wide and an inch deep,‚Äù Matthew Beddall, Havelock‚Äôs founder and CEO, told the Financial Times . ‚ÄúWe try to be a mile deep and an inch wide.‚Äù Havelock aims to emulate Buffett and his mentor, Benjamin Graham, by applying the principles of ‚Äòvalue investing‚Äô‚Äì spotting companies whose intrinsic value isn‚Äôt fully captured by their market valuation. The firm‚Äôs six employees track 38 companies at the moment, and combine their judgement with computing power to identify undervalued businesses and invest in them for the long term, the Financial Times reported. ‚ÄúAt the heart of what we do is estimating what a company is worth based on the economics of its underlying business (aka intrinsic value),‚Äù Beddall told Markets Insider. ‚ÄúWe then place much more weight on our view of the value of a company, than that of the current market price. Lees ook op Business Insider Blik op je Geld: lage hypotheekrente, sterke beurs en lagere energieprijs goed voor je portemonnee ‚ÄúThe simple idea that investors should focus all of their attention on figuring out what companies are worth comes squarely from following Buffett‚Äôs common sense teachings,‚Äù he added. Beddall ‚Äì the former investment chief of Winton Capital Management, one of the world‚Äôs largest quantitative hedge funds ‚Äì founded Havelock in August 2018. The firm now boasts ¬£14 million ($18.2 million) in assets, and invests in stocks and both government and corporate bonds without leverage or shorting. It has returned 5% to date, outstripping the MSCI World Index over the same period, the Financial Times reported. Buffett, the CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, became one of the world‚Äôs richest people by investing in companies such as Coca-Cola, Bank of America, and more recently Apple. However, the so-called ‚ÄúOracle of Omaha‚Äù has come under fire in recent months for a succession of bad bets and missed opportunities, and his failure to deploy the more than $120 billion on his conglomerate‚Äôs balance sheet.

He also added that he doesn‚Äôt view Buffett‚Äôs mistakes as entirely negative. ‚ÄúHe has made some unwise decisions, like purchasing IBM. I find this inspiring as it suggests that he is human!

122,bitcoin,Dark web child abuse: Hundreds arrested across 38 countries - BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The website was operated from South Korea, and its owner is now in jail there More than 300 people have been arrested following the take-down of one of the world's ""largest dark web child porn marketplaces"", investigators said.
The site had more than 200,000 videos which had collectively been downloaded more than a million times.
It was shut down last year after a UK investigation into a child sex offender uncovered its existence.
But on Wednesday, officials revealed that 337 suspected users had been arrested across 38 countries.
US officials unsealed nine indictments against the site's owner Jong Woo Son, 23, from South Korea ‚Äì where he is currently in prison.
The UK's National Crime Agency said arrests had been made in the UK, Ireland, America, South Korea, Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic and Canada - among others.
Fifty children saved as paedophile ring busted Child abuse images being traded via secure apps The site, named Welcome to Video, was run from South Korea and had nearly eight terabytes of content involving child abuse - enough to store hundreds or even thousands of hours of video footage.
Prosecutors said the site had offered videos of sex acts involving children, infants and toddlers ‚Äì and specifically asked users not to upload videos featuring adults-only pornography.
Image copyright NCA UK Image caption A ""this site has been seized"" screen with the logos of US, UK, German and other law enforcement agencies The site was ""one of the first to offer sickening videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin,"" the UK's National Crime Agency said.
It was taken down by an international task force that included agencies from the UK, the US, South Korea and Germany after operating for three years.
It was discovered during an investigation into paedophile Matthew Falder from England, who was jailed for 25 years for sharing abuse tips and images on the dark web .
How global taskforce caught UK paedophile In the UK, seven men have already been convicted in connection with the investigation, including Kyle Fox who was jailed for 22 years last March for the rape of a five-year-old boy and who appeared on the site sexually abusing a three-year-old girl.
Suspects were identified after crime agencies traced the site's cryptocurrency transactions back to them.
About 23 children have been rescued from active abuse situations, the joint task force said at a press conference about the operation.

123,bitcoin,Aziz Com Mirza arrested in Dubai for fraud | Crime ‚Äì Gulf News," Also in this package Fraud victims of Aziz Com Mirza speak out The dodgy investment schemes of Canadian-Pakistani Aziz Com Mirza ‚ÄòSerial‚Äô entrepreneur in Dubai accused of being serial scammer Dubai officials warn about new online extortion scam 'Dead' man comes back to life to scam in Ajman Dubai: A Dubai-based expat accused of defrauding investors worldwide through a string of get-rich-quick schemes seems to have run out of luck.
Canadian man Aziz ‚ÄòCom‚Äô Mirza, who lives in Burj Khalifa, drives supercars and describes himself as serial entrepreneur, mentor, influencer and philanthropist has been arrested and is now in Al Awir jail, Gulf News can confim.
Com, who is of Pakistani origin, was reportedly taken into custody by Bur Dubai Police on October 27 following a complaint of a UAE resident who lost over $150,000 in his dodgy schemes. A source at Dubai Public Prosecution said Mirza is being investigated for fraud and taking money from people illegally.
Gulf News uncovered the racket In April 2019, a Gulf News investigation uncovered how Com Mirza had tricked hundreds into investing into disguised Ponzi schemes, dodgy real estate projects and a crypto currency that is now worthless.
The victims include people from as far as US, UK, Canada and Greece.
Con Mirza Scam - How I was conned out of money - US$380,000 Supplied Most belong to a UK-based online community platform called the Muslim Entrepreneur Network (MEN) which Com Mirza and his brother Rafaqat ‚ÄòRocky‚Äô Mirza got associated with shortly after its launch in 2015.
Once on board, the duo allegedly used the platform to float an investment scheme called the Leverage Programme (LP) which guaranteed ‚Äòfinancial freedom‚Äô within a year.

Members were encouraged to join the network by forking out a minimum of ¬£5,000 each.
Enticed by promises of attractive returns, 300 signed up in early 2017.
Around 1,200 more enrolled a few months later.
Among new recruits was Sharjah-based Umm Rayyan who paid ¬£25,000. ‚ÄúIt was our life-savings,‚Äù she told Gulf News on Monday. ‚ÄúWe were called for a meeting at a mall in Dubai where Com promised us financial freedom within one year. More than two years have passed since then and I have no clue where my money is,‚Äù said the Indian expat.
Who is Com Mirza? A Canadian of Pakistani origin, Aziz ‚ÄòCom‚Äô Mirza describes himself as a serial entrepreneur, investor, social media influencer, mentor, philanthropist and dream chaser. He claims that since launching his first business at age seven with a lemonade stand, he has done business in eight countries.
According to him, he runs multiple companies in technology, real estate, automotive, luxury rental, crypto currency, investment and media industries. Com lives in Burj Khalifa and has over 800,000 followers on Instagram where the feed is filled with pictures of him enjoying hospitality of local hotels and restaurants.
Money trail Nearly ¬£4 million was raised under LP between January 2017 and 2019.
Most of it was wired to the bank account of a Dubai-based firm owned by a third brother of Com Mirza while huge amounts went to pay for personal expenses.
‚ÄúBetween them the brothers took millions of pounds from average people around the globe,‚Äù MEN‚Äôs co-founder Harun Rashid said in an email to Gulf News from London.
Long list of victims Aside from LP, scores more lost money to two other shady schemes fronted by Com Mirza ‚Äî International Success Group (ISG) and a cryptocurrency called Habibi Coin, once billed as the ‚Äúbitcoin of the Middle East‚Äù.
Briton Kalib Hussain, who invested ¬£50,000 in ISG, said the scheme was pitched as an educational subscription website where Com was supposed to teach them how to make the most of their money.
‚ÄúBut somewhere down the line it morphed into an investment programme called ISG Capital Pool which required members to pool in their funds and get guaranteed 10 per cent returns within 12 months from a real-estate project in Dubai,‚Äù recalled Hussain.
New Yorker Tariq Syed who invested $100,000 in ISG said: ‚ÄúCom claimed he was a real estate mogul. We believed him.‚Äù
Devastated Dubai-based sales manager Gulammohiyuddin Maskati, 43, said he‚Äôs devastated having burnt his fingers in ISG and the real estate-backed cryptocurrency Habibi Coin launched by Com as a Sharia compliant currency
‚ÄúI invested $50,000 in ISG and $25,000 in Habibi,‚Äù said Mastaki, one of the many investors who have since filed a police complaint.
John Barry from USA said he invested $500,000 in a scheme after spending a week with Com and talking with people who regarded him highly.
‚ÄúIt was all an illusion,‚Äù he said.
Ippokratis Boboras, who lives in Greece, said she invested $10,000 in Habibi Coin in 2018.
‚ÄúI was familiar with Com Mirza through the internet marketing community where he was considered an authority. I had personal chats with him via Facebook and I sent money to his personal Paypal account,‚Äù Boboras said in an email to Gulf News.
Giannis, also from Greece, said he and his brother jointly invested $17,000 in Habibi after meeting Com at his Burj Khalifa apartment.
‚ÄúHe presented himself as a $500 million dollar entrepreneur,‚Äù said Giannis.
Mohammad Shareef from UK who lost ¬£2000 in Habibi said he didn‚Äôt invest until he visited Com at his office in Dubai and met him in person. ‚ÄúWe spoke for an hour. It wasn‚Äôt until this year that things started going down. Com‚Äôs Instagram posts are now all about food and gym. It‚Äôs been a sad experience for us. Until today there‚Äôs been no official word about what has happened with Habibi Coin,‚Äù said Shareef.
Canadian Abe Arabi ($10,000), Britons Mohammad Vorajee ($2,000), Humaun Rashid (¬£10,000), Abdul Aim (¬£14,000), American Kevin Green (1,500) are among several other Habibi investors with similar stories.

124,bitcoin,More than 330 perverts detained after arrest of one of UK's worst ever paedophiles - Metro.co.uk,"A huge international operation across 38 countries has seen the arrest of more than 330 suspected paedophiles following the arrest of one of Britain‚Äôs worst child abusers.
The global operation has brought down a complex network of perverts allegedly sharing child abuse videos and images on the dark web.
They were all connected to the Welcome to Video website, which contained more than 250,000 videos, following the arrest and subsequent conviction of one of the UK‚Äôs worse ever paedophiles.
Dr Matthew Falder admitted 137 offences in 2017 including encouraging child rape and sharing images of a newborn baby being abused and is serving 25 years behind bars.
The investigations that followed led officers to Jong Woo Son, 23, in South Korea who ran the website. He has been charged in the US and was jailed yesterday in his home country.

The other 337 arrests were made in the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the Czech Republic and Canada. Advertisement Advertisement
Seven men in Britain have already been convicted, including Kyle Fox, 26, who was jailed for 22 years in March for raping a five-year-old boy and appearing on Welcome To Video sexually abusing a three-year-old girl.
People using the website paid using Bitcoins or received credits if they shared their own collections of abuse and their identities on the site were hidden by a Tor browser
Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) used the cryptocurrency transactions to track down Son and the hundreds of users.
In March last year officers travelled to South Korea to help with Son‚Äôs arrest and to take down the servers which supported his site.

NCA operations manager Jason Booth said: ‚ÄòThe site itself didn‚Äôt just focus of child abuse but was a site that had some of the worst child abuse images on it.
‚ÄòIt requested users to pay crypto currency to view images or, if they had their own collections, other people would view it and they would build up credit to view more videos on the site.‚Äô Advertisement Advertisement
NCA Director of Investigations Nikki Holland said: ‚ÄòDark web child sex offenders ‚Äì some of whom are the very worst offenders ‚Äì cannot hide from law enforcement.

125,brexit,PM asks EU for Brexit delay but remains committed to Halloween deadline | Politics News | Sky News,"Boris Johnson has asked the EU for a three-month delay to Brexit, which would extend the Article 50 negotiating period to 31 January 2020.
The request to European Council President Donald Tusk was made in an unsigned letter late on Saturday night.
It came hours after MPs voted to withhold their approval for Mr Johnson's Brexit deal unless and until he has passed all necessary legislation to implement it.
Moment MPs vote to delay Brexit
The prime minister was legally required to request this delay under the so-called ""Benn Act"". The legislation was passed by opposition MPs in September to prevent a no-deal Brexit at the end of this month.
On Twitter, Mr Tusk said: ""The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.""
Advertisement Mr Johnson - who has previously said he would rather die in a ditch than delay Brexit again - has rung European leaders to distance himself from the request, describing it as ""parliament's letter, not my letter"".
The PM has also sent a separate note to Mr Tusk, obtained by Sky News, in which he urged the EU not to grant the extension.

UK sends three letters to the EU What they say - and what they mean
Next week, the prime minister will introduce the legislation needed to put his Brexit deal into UK law, in the hope that a majority of MPs give their backing to his agreement so he can still meet his pledge to take the country out of the EU on 31 October.
On what had been dubbed ""Super Saturday"", the House of Commons voted 322 to 306 in favour of an amendment - proposed by former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin - to the motion on the prime minister's Brexit deal.
How the day unfolded
Sir Oliver had said his amendment was an ""insurance policy"" to prevent Britain ""crashing out"" of the EU without a deal on 31 October.
Mr Johnson wrote to all MPs and peers after the Commons vote to state he will ""not negotiate a delay with the EU"", while he will also tell Brussels that ""further delay is not a solution"".
He also warned the EU could possibly ""reject parliament's request for further delay, or not take a decision quickly"".
How your MP voted on Letwin amendment to PM's Brexit agreement
The prime minister suggested, in those circumstances, MPs could yet be faced with a choice between his deal or a no-deal Brexit.
In a conversation with Mr Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron ""signalled a delay would be in no one's interest"".
MPs withhold approval for Brexit deal - so what happens next?
Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney reiterated Dublin's stance that a Brexit delay is ""preferable"" to a no-deal Brexit, although he also stressed all other EU member states would need to unanimously back an extension for it to be granted.
""Any one prime minister can prevent that and I think the EU wants to see certainty and an end to endless negotiation and speculation, so I think a request for an extension is not straightforward,"" he added.
Defiant PM: 'I will not negotiate a delay'
The DUP gave their backing to Sir Oliver's amendment. In the days leading up to Saturday's sitting, the Northern Irish party had expressed fierce opposition to the prime minister's deal.
Eight of the 21 former Conservative MPs the prime minister withdrew the whip from last month - including ex-cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Justine Greening - also backed Sir Oliver's amendment.
They were among a total of 10 former Tory MPs, who now sit as independents, to support the amendment.
Six Labour MPs defied their party's orders and voted against the amendment.
May: 'I have a distinct sense of deja vu'
There were cheers from among the tens of thousands of people at a People's Vote rally in Westminster, who want a second EU referendum, as the vote result was announced.
Speaking in the Commons after his defeat, Mr Johnson told MPs the so-called meaningful vote on his Brexit deal had ""effectively been passed up because the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning"".
But the prime minister said he was not ""daunted or dismayed"" by what he described as a ""pretty close"" result.
Image: Protesters react after the result of the vote on the deal delay was announced Mr Johnson expressed his hope the EU ""will not be attracted"" to granting an Article 50 extension.
Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, revealed the government will attempt to stage another meaningful vote on the Brexit agreement on Monday.
But Commons Speaker John Bercow hinted he could not allow such a vote as its ""apparent purpose... is to invalidate or obviate"" Sir Oliver's amendment.
Brexit: The uncomfortable truth about Boris Johnson's deal
It has been suggested that if the government did win a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on Monday, the prime minister could withdraw his request for an Article 50 extension or hope it persuades the EU not to grant a delay.
Next week, the government will also introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill needed to put Mr Johnson's Brexit deal into law.
On Twitter, Labour leader Jeremy Quote: : ""I told the prime minister to obey the law and despite his petulant posturing and bluster he finally has - he's asked for an extension. His damaging deal was defeated.""

126,brexit,Brexit: PM sends letter to Brussels seeking further delay - BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: ""I will not negotiate a delay with the EU"" Boris Johnson has sent a request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - but without his signature.
The request was accompanied by a second letter, signed by Mr Johnson, saying he believes a delay would be a mistake.
The PM was required by law to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline after losing a Commons vote.
EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he had received the extension request and would consult EU leaders ""on how to react"".
Earlier, Mr Johnson rang European leaders, including Mr Tusk, to insist that the letter ""is Parliament's letter, not my letter"".
LIVE: Reaction after PM sends Brexit extension letters Jubilant scenes on 'final say' Brexit protest Saturday's Brexit vote: What happens now? Analysis: Another 'meaningful vote'? Opposition MPs have warned the PM that if he tries to circumvent Parliament's instructions to seek a delay, then he may find himself in the law courts.
Mr Johnson has vowed to press ahead with the legislation to implement his deal next week, but Labour says it will seek to amend it - to add additional measures on issues like workers' rights and environmental protections.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News Sophie Ridge the prime minister could ""well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts"" by sending a second letter to the EU that ""contradicted"" the first.
Legal debate The PM has previously said he would ""rather be dead in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexit, and the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"".
But hours after losing a crunch vote in a historic Saturday session in the House of Commons, the prime minister ordered a senior diplomat to send an unsigned photocopy of the request for a delay, which was forced on him by MPs last month.
The second letter from Mr Johnson - signed off this time - makes clear he personally believes a delay would be damaging.
It says the government will press on with efforts to pass the revised Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders last week into law, and that he is confident of doing so by 31 October.
A cover note from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's representative in Brussels, explained the first letter complied with the law as agreed by Parliament.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described the decision to send three documents as ""controversial"", predicting ""there will be a fight about whether Boris Johnson is trying to circumvent the court"".
""This is heading straight for the court, and it may very quickly end up in the Supreme Court,"" she added.
Asked on BBC Breakfast whether the PM's move was ""childish, Conservative Brexiteer MP Nigel Evans said: ""Well he was going to be criticised if he didn't send the letter, because it would have been against the law.""
He added that ""it's not all in our gift"", and that EU leaders may look at both letters and deny the request for a delay.
What did the PM say in the letter he signed? Image copyright Getty/BBC Extracts from Mr Johnson's letter to Mr Tusk:
""The UK Permanent Representative will... submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today. It is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider this request and whether to grant it.
""Although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.
""While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister... that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.
""We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent.""
Read the letters in full.
At the first Saturday sitting in the Commons for 37 years, MPs voted in favour of an amendment withholding approval of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal until all the necessary legislation had been passed.
Tabled by Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, the amendment was intended to ensure that Mr Johnson would comply with the terms of the so-called Benn Act.
Under that act, Mr Johnson had until 23:00 BST on Saturday to send a letter requesting a delay to the UK's departure.
In a letter to MPs and peers on Saturday evening, he said: ""I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as prime minister: further delay is not a solution.
""It is quite possible that our friends in the European Union will reject Parliament's request for a further delay (or not take a decision quickly).""
The Commons defeat marked a major setback for the PM - although Mr Johnson said he was not ""daunted or dismayed"" and remained committed to taking Britain out by the end of the month with his ""excellent deal"".
'Spoilt brat' John McDonnell said MPs should now have the chance to scrutinise the withdrawal agreement legislation. He said Mr Johnson had removed certain protections contained in Theresa May's deal with the EU and Labour wanted to see those reinstated.
""Do we want to go down the Boris Johnson proposals of diverging from our major trading partner and deregulating our economy, undermining workers' rights, consumer and environment rights? No we don't,"" he said.
""So what we'll try and do is, of course, try and amend that legislation and see if we can get agreement in Parliament.""
Mr McDonnell said Mr Johnson was ""behaving a bit like a spoilt brat"" by sending an unsigned letter to Brussels.
Anna Soubry, from The Independent Group for Change, accused the prime minister of acting like a ""truculent child"", while Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine MP said Mr Johnson was going against the will of the Commons.
SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said earlier that if Mr Johnson acted as if he was ""above the law"", he would find himself in court.
On the EU side, there has been no official response yet to the contents of the letter, except Mr Tusk confirming he received it.
But the French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already signalled that he believed a new Brexit extension was not good for anyone.
Reluctant EU considers UK request Image copyright Reuters Boris Johnson literally spelling out his opposition to prolonging the Brexit process by writing a separate letter to Brussels to say so, makes it easier for his peers Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and others to drag their feet a little.
They prefer first to look to the prime minister to make good on his promise to them that their newly-negotiated Brexit deal will *definitely* be passed by Parliament.
But, if push comes to shove, with the alternative being no deal at all... I cannot imagine the EU slamming the door in the face of the UK now.
They will want to know what [the extension] is for. Are there plans in the UK to hold a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on the new Brexit deal? Or is a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation?

The EU Parliament's Brexit Steering Group will discuss the outcome of the latest UK vote on Monday, said Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt.
He tweeted on Saturday: ""Whatever happens next, the marches outside the Parliament show just how important a close EU - UK future relationship is.""
Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons, said the government planed to hold a meaningful vote on Monday - although it is not clear whether Commons Speaker John Bercow will allow it.

127,brexit,Nearly half of UK think Boris Johnson is lying about protecting NHS from Trump trade deal | The Independent,"Nearly half of UK think Boris Johnson is lying about protecting NHS from Trump trade deal The Independent 28/10/2019 Peter Stubley ¬© Provided by Independent Digital News & Media Limited Nearly half the British public think Boris Johnson is lying about protecting the NHS in a trade deal with the US, according to a new survey.
The prime minister has repeatedly claimed that the health service will be ‚Äúoff the table‚Äù during post-Brexit negotiations with Donald Trump.
Now a Survation poll of 2,000 people has found that more than 70 per cent believe the NHS should be safeguarded.
But when asked about the prime minister‚Äôs pledge, 45 per cent said the statement ‚ÄúBoris Johnson is not telling the truth‚Äù was closest to their view.
Just 30 per cent agreed that the leader of the Conservative Party is telling the truth, while 25 per cent said did not know.
Asked how concerned they were about the impact a future trade deal with America could have on the NHS, 35 per cent said they were ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù.
Only 14 per cent of people said they were ‚Äúnot at all concerned‚Äù and 16 per cent said the option of carving up parts of the NHS and allowing foreign control should be an option in any trade deals completed when Britain leaves the European Union.
The survey, carried out online between October 9-14, also found only 18 per cent of people trusted the Tories to ensure it remained a ‚Äúpublicly funded and publicly run‚Äù institution.
A third said they trusted Labour to do so while 24 per cent said they did not trust any party.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg Ellen Lees, campaigns officer for We Own It, the pro-nationalisation group that commissioned the research, said it showed the public were ‚Äúfirmly against‚Äù any health service sell-off.
‚ÄúThis poll shows clearly that the public understand just how big of a threat a US trade deal is to our NHS,‚Äù she added.
‚ÄúAnd it shows that they‚Äôre firmly against the idea that our NHS could be sold off bit by bit to Donald Trump and American private healthcare giants.‚Äù

""They have to leave because that's the will of the people and the Parliament can't oveturn that decision.

129,brexit,"People‚Äôs Vote march: from every corner of the land they came, to join a very British rebellion in the rain | Politics | The Guardian","A s the news of the success of the Letwin amendment filtered out to the hundreds of thousands who had once again marched to Parliament Square to demand a People‚Äôs Vote on the Brexit deal, there was the most reassuringly British of reactions: widespread applause in the rain.
Throaty cheers and whistles gave way to nuanced conversations from under umbrellas and the hoods of cagoules as to what might happen next. Could the prime minister really defy the law on an extension to force his pig-in-lipstick deal through?
Voices from the People‚Äôs Vote march Read more
There had been plenty of good reasons not to travel from the country‚Äôs four corners to march in the capital: the rugby, the money, the ennui. And above all there had been the danger that the timing might make it all futile anyhow. That ‚Äì by the time marchers reached Parliament Square‚Äì the demand for a confirmatory referendum would have finally been thwarted, and the latest million man-woman-and-child march would turn into a wake or a vigil. But the marchers turned up anyway, and they were, under darkening skies, rewarded with yet another possible hint of light.
The prime minister had attempted to choreograph his ‚ÄúSuper Saturday‚Äù session of parliament in the tradition of previous crisis-sittings, those that had assembled for debate about war in 1939 and conflict in Suez in 1956 and the Falklands in 1982.
This time, in Johnson‚Äôs telling, the battle lines were drawn between parliament and the people. By ‚Äúpeople‚Äù Johnson meant that section of the population identified by Nigel Farage on the morning after the referendum vote when, in announcing his poundshop ‚Äúindependence day‚Äù, he had talked of Brexit as a victory for ‚Äúreal people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people .‚Äù
Among the most dangerous themes of that politics of division has been to tell some parts of the population that they are more grounded here in blood and in soil than others. The hundreds of thousands of very real people determined to march once more in London told a very different, more inclusive, island story. One that cuts across borders of politics and circumstance and region. And if ministers had wanted to see the will of those people in full force, they could have looked out of the windows of the Palace of Westminster.

They would have seen people like Dave Blackburn, 62, a support worker for autistic adults, who had come down with a small group overnight on the bus from Glasgow. ‚ÄúIt was getting down to the wire and I still thought there was a chance of a second vote,‚Äù Blackburn told me before the march set off. ‚ÄúMy friends are mostly for Scottish independence, and whatever happens I think that battle will now be won. But I think this, leaving the EU, will anyway be a disaster for working people.‚Äù
His fellow sleepless traveller Sheila Connolly, who works with young homeless people, laughed at how their bus down had been advertised with reclining seats ‚Äúbut that only seemed to apply to seats in front of you‚Äù. She had to be here because she would be devastated if Johnson‚Äôs deal passed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what they say, this is another way for them to come for working people,‚Äù she said.
Or the politicians might have seen Emmanuelle Brook, a teaching assistant in her 40s with two children, among 500 people up from Cornwall. Brook, born in France, has lived in the UK for 24 years. ‚ÄúWe came here on a set of rules we thought would last, and now I have been made a foreigner again,‚Äù she said.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters came from all demographics. Photograph: Tom Corban/Rex/Shutterstock
‚ÄúI get asked where I am from all the time.‚Äù She had been scared about today, had the deal been ratified. ‚ÄúNot just the economics but the human impact of Brexit . I may be safe here, but I no longer feel it.‚Äù
Strangely, as the debates unfolded and the march once again inched toward its destination, there appeared to be no mention of the presence of its massed ranks at the government dispatch box. Not for the first time in recent years it was as if the world inside the chamber bore no relation to that outside its doors, a Westminster bubble indeed. Among the marchers there was, oddly, a similar lack of curiosity about the progress of the debates happening up the road, a sense that everything that could have been said on the subject had long since been said, and that it was now a stubborn numbers game of ayes and noes.
The turnout of marchers, coaches and buses from all over, and their mostly irrepressible good humour, once again provided an alternative set of figures to contemplate. Despite the heckling of Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg , who was with his young son, as they left the Commons, this may well be the most good-natured and well-mannered of protest movements the country has ever mustered, but no one should doubt its determination.

The thousands on the streets in this most British of rebellions was testament to the persistence of that constituency who still believe that ‚Äújust get it done‚Äù is not a basis on which to run a parliamentary democracy. And, like Oliver Letwin, that four hours is not long enough to scrutinise the most significant piece of legislation in a generation.
Talk to almost any one of that number and you would be hard-pressed to make a case against the idea that, at heart, Brexit has become an assault on the salt of the earth. Judith Spencer, who spent her career as a psychologist on the civil servants‚Äô appointment board, is 79; she is walking with the ‚ÄúIn Limbo‚Äù group of EU citizens and UK citizens in Europe, the five million who still live with willed uncertainty. ‚ÄúI was born here half-Japanese in 1940,‚Äù Spencer tells me. ‚ÄúAnd I encountered discrimination from the word go. To see mature professional Europeans who have made their lives here suffering discrimination in this country now really horrified me. Hearing that their kids are being terrorised in the playgrounds. I can feel the country moving backwards.‚Äù

By now, among seasoned marchers, there are few new placards under the sun, but there seemed more saltires and Welsh dragons and county flags alongside EU flags and Union Jacks this time, as people asserted what should never have been in doubt: that all citizens enjoy layers of identity. In among these banners, there was the usual smattering of blunt regional aphorism. A party from Aberdeen had gone with the straightforward ‚ÄúBoris is a Bawbag‚Äù. Those from Stratford had chosen a quote from The Tempest ‚Äúbless our Europe‚Äù. Then there was ‚ÄúBramm orth Brexit‚Äù, which translated, I was reliably informed, with apologies to Monty Python , as ‚ÄúI fart in Brexit‚Äôs general direction.‚Äù
Cassie Histed, a warehouse worker from Warwick, is amused and heartened by the good cheer of the march, the fact that it represents all ages and classes. Most of the marches she has joined in the past have had an angrier edge. She has always identified herself, she tells me, as part of the Sea-Green society which traces its history of protest back to the Levellers of the English civil war. She is on the Europhile wing of that group. ‚ÄúThose who don‚Äôt want to be left adrift in the north Atlantic with Boris steering.‚Äù
Those famed ‚Äúardent‚Äù Leave voters who favour that latter option might swallow the idea that these odd alliances of Remainers are a representation of some elite or other. They may snigger about the commitment of people who are angry at the railroading of our politics but who are not, by nature, angry people. They might, too, however, reflect on the fact that, in three-and-a-half years, the most notable collective showings of Brexit voters has been the 29 March ‚ÄúBrexit Day‚Äù gathering , dominated by the intelligentsia of the Football Lads‚Äô Alliance and their arthritic desire for a ruck in the name of Engerlund.

Martyn Cattermole, a retired management consultant, who was marching with his family, has discovered many things in the course of protests over the last year. One of them is that a hollowed-out Pringles tube makes a very effective loud hailer. He brought his two young sons along, he says, because ‚Äúwe are trying to teach them that democracy doesn‚Äôt just happen or exist ‚Äì you have to keep trying to fight for it‚Äù.

130,brexit,General election: Boris Johnson to ask MPs to back 12 December poll | The Independent,"Boris Johnson has announced he is seeking a 12 December general election .And the prime minister said that in return for backing his plan on Monday, he will offer MPs more time to debate and scrutinise his Brexit deal.In a broadcast interview shortly after a surprise cabinet meeting in 10 Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ‚ÄúThe way to get Brexit done is to be reasonable with parliament and say if they genuinely want more time to study this excellent deal, they can have it, but they have to agree to a general election on 12 December.‚ÄùFrom extras.The announcement amounts to his first admission that he has missed his 31 October deadline for taking the UK out of the European Union.In a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , he said that if the date was approved, the government would make as much time available as possible up to 6 November to scrutinise and pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, including weekends and extended sitting hours.Mr Johnson said it would be ‚Äúmorally incredible‚Äù if Labour blocked the election in a vote on Monday which requires a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons, which he has already twice been refused.Many Labour MPs are fiercely opposed to granting Mr Johnson an election at a time when Tories have no majority in the Commons but are leading the polls by double-digit margins and Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs party is scraping along around 25 per cent - less than Michael Foot recorded in the disastrous 1983 ballot.",2019-10-24T20:18:00.000+03:00,independent.co.uk,boris_johnson|*|announce|*|-pron-|*|seek|*|december|*|general_election|*|prime_minister|*|return|*|-pron-|*|plan|*|monday|*|-pron-|*|offer|*|mps|*|time|*|debate|*|scrutinise|*|-pron-|*|brexit_deal|*|broadcast|*|interview|*|shortly|*|surprise|*|cabinet_meeting|*|downing|*|street|*|mr_johnson|*|way|*|brexit|*|reasonable|*|parliament|*|-pron-|*|genuinely|*|want|*|time|*|study|*|excellent|*|deal|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|agree|*|general_election|*|december|*|extra|*|announcement|*|-pron-|*|admission|*|-pron-|*|miss|*|-pron-|*|october|*|deadline|*|uk|*|european_union|*|letter|*|labour|*|leader|*|jeremy_corbyn|*|-pron-|*|date|*|approve|*|government|*|time|*|available|*|possible|*|november|*|scrutinise|*|pass|*|withdrawal|*|agreement|*|bill|*|include|*|weekend|*|extended|*|sit|*|hour|*|mr_johnson|*|-pron-|*|morally|*|incredible|*|labour|*|block|*|election|*|vote|*|monday|*|require|*|majority|*|house_of_commons|*|-pron-|*|twice|*|refuse|*|labour_mp|*|fiercely|*|opposed|*|grant|*|mr_johnson|*|election|*|time|*|tory|*|majority|*|commons|*|lead|*|poll|*|double|*|digit|*|margin|*|jeremy_corbyn|*|party|*|scrape|*|cent|*|michael|*|foot|*|record|*|disastrous|*|ballot
131,brexit,CCTV shows Essex lorry minutes before 39 people found dead inside | UK News | Sky News,"Private ambulances under police escort are transporting some of the 39 bodies found in a lorry container in Essex to a hospital for post-mortems.
At least 11 of the victims discovered at an industrial estate this week, who police have said are believed to be Chinese, have been taken from the Port of Tilbury to Broomsfield Hospital in Chelmsford.
The bodies are being transported in stages and are all expected to be moved by the end of the week.
Image: A vigil took place outside the Home Office for the victims The post-mortems come after the 31 men and eight women were found at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday.
Later that day, they were moved to a more sensitive site at nearby Tilbury Docks as police try to identify them.
Advertisement Vigils have been held outside the Home Office in London, as well as in Brighton and Belfast, to pay tribute to the victims, and officers and local councillors in Essex have signed a book of condolence.
Flowers have also been left at the entrance to the industrial estate where the discovery was made, which has led to the largest murder investigation ever carried out by Essex Police.

State newspaper Global Times has said Britain should bear some responsibility, saying: ""It is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death.""

Essex lorry deaths: Timeline of events
The Chinese embassy has sent a team to Essex, but the foreign affairs ministry said there was ""no confirmation"" the victims were Chinese and that police were ""still working on identifying"".
Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: ""We hope the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case.""
The driver was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder after police were called at 1.40am and officers were granted an extra 24 hours of custody time to continue questioning him on Thursday.
Sky sources have named the suspect as Mo Robinson, from Portadown.
The lorry cab he was driving had started its journey in Northern Ireland before meeting the trailer in Purfleet.
Irish firm Global Trailer Rental said it owned the container and rented it out on 15 October, according to reports.
The container is said to have been fitted with a GPS tracking system , which police should be able to use to work out its precise movements leading up to the discovery.
Police in Northern Ireland have been searching three addresses in County Armagh following the arrest of the driver on suspicion of murder, which is said to have left his family ""stunned"".

They only found out about the arrest when a picture of Mr Robinson, 25, appeared in the media.
Their local councillor, Paul Berry, told Sky News: ""His family are very well respected in the area and are very actively involved in community organisations.
""Our heart goes out to them because as of yesterday morning they were not aware that he had been arrested.""
He added: ""The community's thoughts and prayers are with the family of the 39 people who have lost their lives. People are devastated but also stunned and shocked that someone local has been arrested.""

Essex lorry deaths: Belgian port Zeebrugge identified as smuggling hot spot in 2016
Belgian authorities believe the container was transported to the UK from Zeebrugge at 2.49pm local time on Tuesday.
Lorry driver Graham Westmorland told Sky News that scanners at the port were not up to the job and people were able to get through without being picked up.
Such criticism has been disputed by Mayor Dirk De Fauw, also the chairman of the port of Zeebrugge, who insisted that it was ""virtually impossible"" the victims went into the trailer at the Belgian border.
He told Belgian media: ""Each trailer is systematically checked to look for outward signs of damage. Then it is sealed. Trailers are filmed until they are on the ferry.
""In the terminals too there are cameras. Breaking the seal, putting 39 people in a trailer and resealing the trailer without anybody noticing is virtually impossible.""
Image: Police escorted the lorry away from the scene of the discovery
How are migrants getting to the UK and how many are attempting the journey?
The Belgian public prosecutor's office said it is ""not yet clear"" when and where the victims were placed in the container, adding that no further information would be released at this time.
Its statement said it would continue to work with police in the UK to find out what happened.
Image: Forensic officers investigate the lorry After the arrival of the trailer in Purfleet at around midnight on Wednesday morning, it was picked up by Mr Robinson.
Essex Police say the lorry cab had began its journey in Northern Ireland, from where it headed to Dublin and then caught a ferry to Holyhead in north Wales.
CCTV has shown the lorry cab with container attached being driven towards the industrial park at 1.10am, half an hour before Essex Police were called to the scene by ambulance crews.
The Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the Scania truck was registered in Varna and prime minister Boyko Borissov said the vehicle had not entered the country since 2017.
Road haulage experts said temperatures in refrigerated units can be as low as -25C.
Officers say people who are concerned about a loved one should call 0800 056 0944, or 0044 207 158 0010 if calling from abroad.

132,brexit,Brexit news: Gina Miller unveils new Remainer plot to block Brexit in general election | UK | News | Express.co.uk,"GINA MILLER outlined a new technique she has developed for Remain voters to stop the UK leaving the EU under a hard Brexit in a general election. PUBLISHED: 00:01, Thu, Oct 24, 2019 | UPDATED: 07:33, Thu, Oct 24, 2019 0
The businesswoman referred to a website she has created that gives Remain voters the ‚Äúopportunity to lend your vote in tactical voting‚Äù. Sky News presenter Adam Boulton accused Gina Miller of trying to ‚Äústop Brexit ‚Äù altogether, to which she argued ‚Äúeverything that happens in the House has to be legal‚Äù. Mr Boulton asked: ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre running a website for tactical voting, what‚Äôs that all about?‚Äù Related articles Lord Heseltine launches attack on Boris Johnson's Brexit campaign
Ms Miller explained: ‚ÄúWe will do if an election is called, which I think will be imminent.
‚ÄúWe will say to Remain voters that if you want your voice heard in a first-past-the-post system then there‚Äôs an opportunity to lend your vote in a tactical voting recommended position of where you think your vote would be most affected if you want to remain in the EU.‚Äù
Mr Boulton remarked: ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre quite open, because when you took the original case for the meaningful vote you said it wasn‚Äôt about stopping Brexit.
‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is your position now is you are campaigning to stop Brexit full stop.‚Äù Brexit news: Gina Miller said she has created a new website to help Remainers tactically vote (Image: Sky News) Brexit news: Gina Miller claimed it is ""time"" for a general election (Image: Sky News)
Ms Miller disagreed: ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not. One is everything that happens in that House has to be legal, so that is one part of the actions that I‚Äôm doing and the campaigning.
‚ÄúThe other part is to say to people if you want to dent a huge majority that‚Äôs going to take us towards a hard Brexit, then there‚Äôs the opportunity to vote tactically.‚Äù
Earlier in the interview, Ms Miller also claimed it ‚Äúis time‚Äù for a general election.
She commented: ‚ÄúI think now, because of where Parliament is, we will see day after day of torturous voting and debate as we go forward. Brexit news: Adam Boulton quizzed the businesswoman on whether she is ""stopping"" Brexit (Image: Sky News)
‚ÄúSo I have to say my opinion is I think it is time we went towards a general election, because we can‚Äôt have this stalemate. Everything is being politicised, and I think it is time to actually go and ask the country what they think.‚Äù
The comments follow a turbulent evening in the House of Commons, after MPs refused to give the Prime Minister‚Äôs Brexit plans their full backing. MPs voted through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, in a historic move, by 329 votes to 299, majority 30, with 19 Labour MPs opting to side with the Government.
But, just minutes later, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Brexit plan was halted in its tracks, after Parliamentarians voted by 322 to 308 to reject Mr Johnson's plan to take the legislation through the Commons in just three days.

133,brexit,EarthLink - News,"Fed cuts rates for a 3rd time but signals it will now pause
By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER | Wed, October 30, 2019 05:53 EDT
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates Wednesday for a third time this year to try to support the economy. But it signaled that it plans no further cuts unless it sees clear evidence that the economic outlook has worsened.
For now, Chairman Jerome Powell sounded a bullish note about the economy in a news conference after the Fed's latest policy meeting. Despite some signs of weakness, the Fed expects growth to continue and the job market to remain strong.
Since spring, manufacturing output has stumbled amid trade tensions and slower global growth, while businesses have cut spending on large equipment. But Powell stressed that the Fed doesn't see those trends weakening the broader economy. Instead, steady hiring is keeping unemployment very low, boosting consumer confidence, and encouraging more spending.
""Monetary policy is in a good place,"" Powell said. ""If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a pre-set course.""
Some of the global and trade threats that have been bedeviling the economy have receded, Powell said, thereby reducing the need for future rate cuts. The U.S. and China have reached a tentative truce that has cooled their trade war. And the European Union has agreed to extend the deadline for the United Kingdom's exit from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31, lowering the likelihood of an economically disorderly ""no deal"" Brexit.
""On both, the risks appear to have subsided,"" he said. ""That could bode well for business confidence and activity over time.""
Investors appeared pleased with Powell's positive take on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 115 points, or 0.4%. Analysts also noted that the year's third rate cut had been widely expected and that expectations for another cut at the Fed's next meeting, in December, were already dim.
""He clearly set the bar high for rate cuts in December and January,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.
But Bostjancic and some other economists say they expect growth to keep slowing and to eventually force the Fed's hand. Bostjancic expects growth to decline to just 1.6% in 2020, below the Fed's forecast of 2%, and that the policymakers will cut rates sometime next spring.
Powell may be too optimistic about a defusing of the China trade and Brexit threats, Bostjancic said. While President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are seeking to agree to an initial pact next month, it would likely leave many significant areas of dispute between the two countries unresolved.
""He was wearing a little bit of rosy glasses with the trade talks and Brexit,"" she said. ""Trade tensions are still going to remain.""
The Fed's move Wednesday reduces the short-term rate it controls ‚Äî which influences many consumer and business loans ‚Äî to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.
The policymakers dropped from their statement a key phrase they had used since June to indicate that a future rate cut was likely. That phrase said they would ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion."" The Fed's new statement says instead that it will review the latest economic data as ""it assesses the appropriate path"" for its benchmark interest rate.
Two of the Fed's policymakers dissented from the decision: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George said they preferred to leave rates alone. Both have dissented from all three rate cuts this year.
The economy is in its 11th year of expansion, fueled by consumer spending and a solid if slightly weakened job market. By cutting rates, the Fed has tried to counter uncertainties heightened by Trump's trade conflicts, a weaker global economy and a decline in U.S. manufacturing.
The third rate cut of the year has partly reversed the four hikes that the Fed made last year in response to a strengthening economy. That was before rising global risks led the Fed to change course and begin easing credit. Lower rates are intended to encourage more borrowing and spending.
Powell has said that the central bank's rate reductions were intended as a kind of insurance against threats to the economy. Powell has pointed to similar rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as precedents; in both those cases, the Fed cut rates three times. He and most other Fed officials credit their rate cuts with lowering mortgage rates, boosting home sales and generally keeping the economy on track.
The Fed is also weighing the consequences of a decline in expectations for inflation. Lower inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. This can pose a problem for the Fed because its preferred inflation gauge has been stuck below its 2% target for most of the past seven years.
In the meantime, Trump, via Twitter, has renewed his attacks on the Fed for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero. The president has contrasted the Fed's actions unfavorably with central banks in Europe and Japan, which have slashed their rates into negative territory. Though Trump has argued that this puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage, most economists regard negative rates as a sign of weakness.
The U.S. economy is still growing, and hiring remains steady, though there have been signs of a slowdown in recent data. Americans cut back on spending at retailers and restaurants last month, a worrisome sign because consumer spending is the leading engine of economic growth. Still, consumer confidence remains high, and shoppers could easily rebound in the coming months.
Earlier Wednesday, the government estimated that the economy grew at a tepid but steady 1.9% annual rate during the July-September quarter. That report showed that businesses cut back on their investment in new equipment and buildings by the most in nearly four years.
But it also showed that the housing market helped drive growth for the first time in seven quarters, as home purchases and renovations have increased. Powell credited the Fed's interest rate cuts for spurring those gains, along with greater spending on cars and appliances.

137,brexit,"No-deal Brexit means return of battery eggs, farmers' union warns | Politics | The Guardian","NFU says government has ignored call for tariffs on cheap US imports from caged hens @lisaocarroll Tue 29 Oct 2019 06.00 GMT
Eggs from battery hens will return to British supermarket shelves if the government fails to strike a new trading deal with the EU and crashes out of the bloc, the National Farmers‚Äô Union has warned.
The NFU says the government has ignored its pleas to put tariffs on eggs to protect against cheaper rivals from countries such as the US where caging hens is allowed.
‚ÄúWe will be importing eggs produced in those very same cages we banned in 2012,‚Äù said the NFU president, Minette Batters.
Tariffs on farm and other produce will come in at the end of the transition period after Brexit whether a deal with the EU is done or not, and will affect all imports from third countries.
But the NFU is baffled by the decision by the government to put tariffs on lamb to protect vulnerable sheep farmers, but not to impose them on eggs or wheat.
The NFU wrote to the Treasury immediately after it announced its draft tariff schedule in March pointing out the risks its plan was creating for three agriculture products: eggs, horticulture and grains.
In its final tariff schedule published three weeks ago the three categories were rated at zero, meaning US producers, who can raise laying hens more cheaply because of the intensity of battery farming, will be able to undercut British eggs.
Batters said the NFU had begged the new environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, to think again about the final tariff schedule, but that all the minister was interested in was ‚Äúleaving the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal‚Äù.
‚ÄúThere is no engagement on the issues,‚Äù she said.
Asked how the government had responded when told of the urgency of imposing tariffs, Batters said: ‚ÄúThey just shrug their shoulders.
‚ÄúWe represent small family farming businesses and those farmers are not being allowed a say at all. They are just effectively going to be put out of business with a tariff schedule ‚Ä¶ [that the government] are not even prepared to look at again. And this is a party that proposes to represent rural Britain?‚Äù
On Sunday the international trade secretary, Liz Truss, insisted the government would ‚Äúwalk away‚Äù from negotiations with Washington if a deal was not ‚Äúright for Britain‚Äù.
She told John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live the government was ‚Äúnot going to alter domestic standards for the sake of trade deals‚Äù.
But the NFU argues that the trading environment for egg and wheat farmers will change even if there is no trade deal with the US.
‚ÄúIf you have 0% tariffs on eggs, how are you going to stop eggs, particularly liquid and dried egg, coming into the UK that has been produced in systems that are illegal in the UK?‚Äù said Batters.
‚ÄúWe do not want to see deregulation on animal welfare. The general public don‚Äôt either, but do they realise this is happening?‚Äù
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said tariffs would only be imposed for 12 months before new deals were struck, but the NFU said that would be too late for some egg producers, who risked going out of business in the face of cheap competition.
‚ÄúWe have driven one of the safest food systems in the world ‚Äì food traceability, farm-assured red tractor , RSPCA and others ‚Äì and where is the democracy in making this decision? Parliament hasn‚Äôt discussed this. There has been no Panorama programme on it. How do you hold the PM to account?‚Äù said Batters.
Egg production is a hugely successful business in the UK, with 90% of the 12bn eggs consumed a year laid by British hens, and the NFU cannot understand why a British government does not want to protect it.
‚ÄúFarmers feel betrayed. If this is what is going to happen, it is going to put some people out of business, as simple as that ‚Äì the simple law of markets and economics,‚Äù Batters said.
The government is legally obliged to publish a tariff schedule under World Trade Organization trading and revealed what rates it had settled on in March with a draft schedule for every potential import from cars to agriculture.
ÔªøDefra said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe will make sure that Brexit works for farmers across the whole country and will not compromise on our high food or animal welfare standards when we leave the EU.
‚ÄúOur temporary tariff regime will also balance support for British jobs, protect sensitive farming sectors and avoid consumer price increases should we leave the EU without a deal on 31 October.‚Äù Topics ",2019-10-29T08:00:00.000+02:00,theguardian.com,nfu|*|government|*|ignore|*|tariff|*|cheap|*|import|*|caged|*|hen|*|tue|*|oct|*|gmt|*|egg|*|battery|*|hen|*|return|*|british|*|supermarket|*|shelf|*|government|*|fail|*|strike|*|new|*|trading|*|deal|*|eu|*|crash|*|bloc|*|national|*|farmers|*|union|*|warn|*|nfu|*|government|*|ignore|*|-pron-|*|plea|*|tariff|*|egg|*|protect|*|cheap|*|rival|*|country|*|cage|*|hen|*|allow|*|-pron-|*|import|*|egg|*|produce|*|cage|*|-pron-|*|ban|*|nfu|*|president|*|minette|*|batters|*|tariff|*|farm|*|produce|*|come|*|end|*|transition|*|period|*|brexit|*|deal|*|eu|*|affect|*|import|*|country|*|nfu|*|baffle|*|decision|*|government|*|tariff|*|lamb|*|protect|*|vulnerable|*|sheep|*|farmer|*|impose|*|-pron-|*|egg|*|wheat|*|nfu|*|write|*|treasury|*|immediately|*|-pron-|*|announce|*|-pron-|*|draft|*|tariff|*|schedule|*|march|*|point|*|risk|*|-pron-|*|plan|*|create|*|agriculture|*|product|*|egg|*|horticulture|*|grain|*|-pron-|*|final|*|tariff|*|schedule|*|publish|*|week|*|ago|*|category|*|rate|*|zero|*|mean|*|producer|*|raise|*|lay|*|hen|*|cheaply|*|intensity|*|battery|*|farming|*|able|*|undercut|*|british|*|egg|*|batter|*|nfu|*|beg|*|new|*|environment|*|secretary|*|theresa|*|villiers|*|think|*|final|*|tariff|*|schedule|*|minister|*|interested|*|leave_the_eu|*|october|*|deal|*|deal|*|engagement|*|issue|*|-pron-|*|ask|*|government|*|respond|*|tell|*|urgency|*|impose|*|tariff|*|batters|*|-pron-|*|shrug|*|-pron-|*|shoulder|*|-pron-|*|represent|*|small|*|family|*|farming|*|business|*|farmer|*|allow|*|-pron-|*|effectively|*|business|*|tariff|*|schedule|*|government|*|prepared|*|look|*|party|*|propose|*|represent|*|rural|*|britain|*|sunday|*|international|*|trade|*|secretary|*|liz|*|truss|*|insist|*|government|*|walk_away|*|negotiation|*|washington|*|deal|*|right|*|britain|*|-pron-|*|tell|*|john|*|pienaar|*|bbc|*|radio|*|live|*|government|*|alter|*|domestic|*|standard|*|sake|*|trade_deal|*|nfu|*|argue|*|trading|*|environment|*|egg|*|wheat|*|farmer|*|change|*|trade_deal|*|-pron-|*|tariff|*|egg|*|-pron-|*|stop|*|egg|*|particularly|*|liquid|*|dry|*|egg|*|come|*|uk|*|produce|*|system|*|illegal|*|uk|*|batters|*|-pron-|*|want|*|deregulation|*|animal|*|welfare|*|general|*|public|*|-pron-|*|realise|*|happen|*|department|*|environment|*|food|*|rural|*|affairs|*|defra|*|tariff|*|impose|*|month|*|new|*|deal|*|strike|*|nfu|*|late|*|egg|*|producer|*|risk|*|business|*|face|*|cheap|*|competition|*|-pron-|*|drive|*|safe|*|food|*|system|*|world|*|food|*|traceability|*|farm|*|assure|*|red|*|tractor|*|rspca|*|democracy|*|decision|*|parliament|*|discuss|*|panorama|*|programme|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|hold|*|pm|*|account|*|batters|*|egg|*|production|*|hugely|*|successful|*|business|*|uk|*|egg|*|consume|*|year|*|lay|*|british|*|hen|*|nfu|*|understand|*|british|*|government|*|want|*|protect|*|-pron-|*|farmer|*|feel|*|betray|*|happen|*|-pron-|*|people|*|business|*|simple|*|simple|*|law|*|market|*|economic|*|batter|*|government|*|legally|*|oblige|*|publish|*|tariff|*|schedule|*|world|*|trade|*|organization|*|trading|*|reveal|*|rate|*|-pron-|*|settle|*|march|*|draft|*|schedule|*|potential|*|import|*|car|*|agriculture|*|statement|*|-pron-|*|sure|*|brexit|*|work|*|farmer|*|country|*|compromise|*|-pron-|*|high|*|food|*|animal|*|welfare|*|standard|*|-pron-|*|leave_the_eu|*|-pron-|*|temporary|*|tariff|*|regime|*|balance|*|support|*|british|*|job|*|protect|*|sensitive|*|farming|*|sector|*|avoid|*|consumer|*|price|*|increase|*|-pron-|*|leave_the_eu|*|deal|*|october|*|topic

‚ÄúOften I‚Äôm working a really long day to make ¬£30 or ¬£40 profit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe felt as if the Turners could be the family on the next street, around the corner from Daniel Blake,‚Äù Ken says.
‚ÄúThe films go together in many ways because when we were in the foodbanks researching I, Daniel Blake, we found so many there were in work ‚Äì hungry because of the gig economy.‚Äù
Like Tory immigration policy and the welfare state, this is another hostile environment where workers denied breaks urinate in plastic bottles.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not capitalism failing, it‚Äôs capitalism working,‚Äù Ken says.
Sorry We Missed You is the shameful story of so many precarious workers whose stories we‚Äôve told in this column.
The mothers working hours after giving birth or delivering parcels the day of their dad‚Äôs funeral.
But most of all, it‚Äôs told in memory of the late Don Lane, the man who Ken spoke so movingly about last week on Question Time.
A 53-year-old van driver, Don was diabetic but fined ¬£150 a day when he went to hospital appointments.
On those days he earned nothing but still had to pay for his van. So, he started missing hospital appointments to avoid getting further into debt.
The film tackles the issue of zero hour contracts (Image: Handout pr) &apos;Hero&apos; Ken Loach&apos;s Question Time speech about van driver &apos;killed by gig economy&apos; ‚ÄúHe collapsed and died,‚Äù Ken says. ‚ÄúNow you tell me that‚Äôs justified, you tell me that‚Äôs right ‚Äì that a worker is so terrified to have a day off for sickness because he will be fined and he dies. That‚Äôs the gig economy, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs doing to working people.‚Äù
Loach‚Äôs genius over many years, from Kes in 1969 to Raining Stones in 1993 and now, has been to hold a mirror up to lives held back by exploitation and poverty.
Sorry We Missed You exposes the shiny new world of the gig economy as the same old abuse of power by venal corporate interests.
The film comes out today with ¬≠critical timing ‚Äì just as Britain faces a general election .
This, after all, is the outsourced, zero hour Britain the Tory government has been building since 2010.
And it could be their greatest vulnerability at the ballot box because Labour has promised to radically ¬≠overhaul the system.
‚ÄúRicky is the victim of bogus self-employment,‚Äù Ken says of the film.
‚ÄúAnd the good thing is Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell understand exactly how that is working and how to put a stop to it.
""They also know that one way to solve Ricky‚Äôs problem is to take the post office back into public ownership and use that instead of private delivery companies.
""Meanwhile, for carers like Abbie, those social care jobs need to come back under direct employment, to the NHS,‚Äù Ken says. ‚ÄúThis is what Labour will do.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe provoked strikes she knew she could win. She wanted mass unemployment. If there are 10 other people who want the job, employers can drive down wages.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just postal workers and carers, it‚Äôs happened across the NHS where jobs have been outsourced ‚Äì to cleaners, caterers, nurses from ¬≠agencies.‚Äù
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has just gambled the House on an election he hopes will rig the Commons in favour of a hard or no-deal Brexit .
‚ÄúThe Brexit Boris Johnson wants will roll out the red carpet for American business to exploit cheap labour with no responsibilities for the employer,‚Äù Ken says.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all they want ‚Äì access to the NHS market and cheap labour.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just end up with the NHS logo stamped on services provided by private companies. The service will be less good. They‚Äôll say it‚Äôs free at the point of use, but it will have been privatised by public money.‚Äù
HOMELESS
The last time I interviewed Ken Loach, then aged 80, he said I, Daniel Blake would be his last film.
Now, at 83, he‚Äôs here with a companion piece. The sad thing is that if there is a third film in this trilogy, it‚Äôs Cathy Come Home, directed by Loach in 1966.
Nine years of austerity and the streets of Soho, where I interview him, are lined with homeless people again.
As courier Patrick Tucker says: ‚ÄúThe system is broken. We‚Äôre working all the hours we can, but we can‚Äôt make it work. You have to ask yourself, who is benefitting from this? Who is it ¬≠actually working for?‚Äù
His words echo Abbie in the film: ‚ÄúThe harder we work, the more hours we do, we just sink further and further into this big hole.‚Äù
Patrick has joined the grassroots Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which is organising gig economy workers across dozens of sectors.
Yesterday it even took on 5 Hertford Street, the private members‚Äô club dubbed ‚ÄúBrexit HQ‚Äù, owned by Boris Johnson donor Robin Birley, over outsourcing its kitchen porters.

139,brexit,Murder investigation as 39 bodies found inside lorry container in Essex,"Essex lorry deaths: Police probe suspected Irish people-smuggling ring after 39 migrants found frozen to death Save
P olice are investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring after 39 migrants were found frozen to death in the back of a refrigerated lorry.
One of UK's biggest murder inquiries was launched on Wednesday after the bodies, including that of a teenager, were found dead in the truck on an Essex industrial estate.
The container carrying the people arrived at Purfleet, close to Tilbury Docks, from Zeebrugge, in Belgium, at 12.30am on Wednesday.
It left the docks at 1.05am on the back of the cab which had entered the UK via Holyhead from Dublin four days earlier.
Just 35 minutes later the police were alerted that the truck was on an industrial estate in nearby Grays, Essex and the bodies had been found inside.
The driver of the cab, named locally as Mo Robinson, 25, from County Armagh in Northern Ireland, was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Mr Robinson may have alerted the authorities himself, it emerged. Sources close to the investigation told the Telegraph that it is ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù that he knew about the plans to smuggle people across borders.
Temperatures in the refrigerated truck get as low as -25C and sources said the people are likely to have died from suspected hypothermia.
B oris Johnson, the Prime Minister, said the perpetrators of the crime ""should be hunted down"". Industrial estate lorry trailer deaths map
L ocal MP Jackie Doyle-Price said that putting ""39 people into a locked metal container shows a contempt for human life that is evil"" and said that the best way to honour their memory was to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, described it as a ""truly shocking incident"" as she signalled she is willing to consider tougher sentences for human traffickers.
""What we have seen basically through the actions of these traffickers is the worst of humanity and it is right that we use our law enforcement and all aspects of the law through existing legislation to make sure that justice is served and that the perpetrators are prosecuted,"" she told the House of Commons.
Police were on Wednesday night probing the links to Bulgaria as it emerged that the truck‚Äôs cab had been registered there in 2017.
The country‚Äôs foreign ministry said it had been registered in the city of Varna under the name of a company owned by an Irish woman and had not returned since 2017.
The area is a cigarette and fuel smuggling route which is known locally to have links to Irish Republican gangs.
T he container has been linked to a company which has an office address in Dublin but is registered across the border in Northern Ireland.
Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said that ‚Äúin order to ensure we maintain the dignity of the people who sadly lost their lives‚Äù they had moved the truck with the bodies inside to Tilbury docks as they start the ‚Äúlong process‚Äù of identifying the victims.
""We are yet to identify them and must manage this sensitively with their families,"" she added.
The nationality of the migrants and the place where they began their journey remains unclear. Detectives are looking closely at the routes that have been used to bring migrants into the country.
The news comes after repeated warnings about Britain‚Äôs porous borders after a crackdown on people travelling from Dover and Calais.
T he National Crime Agency (NCA) warned last year that Belgium was new frontier in the battle against illegal immigration as people smugglers moved to evade tougher security elsewhere along the coast.
The NCA also warned there had been a rise in the number of migrants using ‚Äúhigher risk methods of clandestine entry‚Äù to the UK such as refrigerated HGVs and containers, as well as small boats.
R oad Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said on Wednesday that smugglers had been looking at other routes because of a tightening of security.
‚ÄúAt Dover and Calais, you've got far more checks that are taking place there. You've got heartbeat monitors, you've got dogs, you've got CO2. Those checks are done as you drive through.‚Äù
Zeebrugge's harbour master said they found migrants trying to stowaway ""every day"" at the Belgian port.
The Government says it is recruiting an extra 1,400 border staff after people smuggling became an increasing issue over the summer.
The discovery is not the worst of its kind in the UK. The bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container at Dover, Kent, in 2000. What we know so far 39 bodies found in lorry container Driver from Northern Ireland arrested Lorry cabin registered in Bulgaria, police believe Container docked in Essex having travelled from Belgium Bodies discovered at Waterglade Industrial Park, Grays The complicated route of the lorry
The lorry's cabin is understood to have been registered in Bulgaria.
But police say its journey to Essex originated in Northern Ireland.
The container in which the bodies were found, however, arrived in Essex from a different location.
I t left Zeebrugge on the Belgian coast and travelled to Purfleet in Essex, docking in the Thurrock area at 12.30am.
The cabin picked up the container and police believe the cabin and the container left the docking area shortly after 1.05am.
At 1.40am, Essex Police were called to the discovery of bodies. The ambulance had been called and paramedics alerted the police.
Early on Wednesday morning, police had wrongly said both the container and the cabin had entered mainland Britain through Holyhead. CCTV captures lorry half an hour before police discovery

T he entrance to the industrial estate where the lorry was parked - a 10 minute drive from the centre of Gray‚Äôs and equally close to the Thames Estuary - was sealed off by police on Wednesday morning.
Officers erected thick green sheeting across at the gates to the estate on Eastern Avenue to prevent passers-by from observing the grim work of forensics officers who spent the morning climbing in and out of the abandoned freight unit.
A tent was also erected in front of the back of the lorry to allow officers to gather and collate material removed from where the corpses were found. The lorry in which 39 bodies were found Credit: Steve Finn
M uch of the area where the lorry was found is composed of vast industrial estates and freight handling centres, with hundreds of lorries arriving and leaving on any normal day.
The freight unit where the bodies were found was rented from a firm called GTR Trailer Rental Solutions and parked between three warehouses, one for a refrigeration firm called Chill Box; the other for GFS Car Parts and the third Southern Drains.
The cab of the lorry was decorated with stickers, including one across the top of the windscreen reading Ireland, with two Celtic harps on either side, and one at the bottom staring: ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Dream.‚Äù
In the window of the Scania lorry cab hung a ‚Äòdream catcher‚Äô or sacred hoop lucky talisman.
It is thought the lorry cab was registered in the Irish Republic. Boris Johnson 'appalled' by 'tragic incident'
Boris Johnson has reacted to the news by saying he was ""appalled"" by the developments in Essex. I‚Äôm appalled by this tragic incident in Essex. I am receiving regular updates and the Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened. My thoughts are with all those who lost their lives & their loved ones. ‚Äî Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 23, 2019
H ome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: ""Shocked and saddened by this utterly tragic incident in Grays.
""Essex Police has arrested an individual and we must give them the space to conduct their investigations.""
I ndependent MP Nick Boles tweeted: ""Every now and then something truly appalling breaks through the Brexit fog enveloping Parliament and reminds us how many more important issues are being neglected as we spin our wheels in this quagmire.

141,brexit,Charlotte Gainsbourg: ‚ÄòEverything now is so politically correct. So boring‚Äô | Culture | The Guardian,"The actor and singer grew up in her parents‚Äô shadow, and starred in Lars Von Trier‚Äôs most extreme films. She talks about why she‚Äôs finally comfortable in her own skin. W hen Charlotte Gainsbourg was 16, she came home from school to find her mother distraught and the police waiting for her. They had just discovered that she was the target of a kidnapping plot. A gang of upper-class teenagers ‚Äì journalists called them the blousons dor√©s (golden jacket) gangsters ‚Äì had planned to kill a police officer and steal his uniform. Then, using this disguise, they were going to abduct Gainsbourg and demand a 5m franc ransom from her famous parents, Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. The gang, who had already committed several armed robberies, had found a country house where they were going to hide Gainsbourg. They had even bought shovels with which to bury the police officer.
Gainsbourg laughs as she recounts the episode: ‚ÄúI thought it was so cool.‚Äù Her mother and father weren‚Äôt quite so blase. ‚ÄúI remember my parents being extremely scared and my father made me go to school with a bodyguard.‚Äù She stares into her coffee, stirring in milk for longer than is necessary. ‚ÄúI was so ashamed.‚Äù
Gainsbourg and I are sitting in a chic but uncomfortable corner booth in a hotel cafe in Greenwich Village, New York. The singer, actor and style champion has just come back from Paris fashion week; French Vogue is full of pictures of her looking glam in a see-through shirt and tailored suit. She is dressed more simply today, wearing what she describes as her ‚Äújean uniform‚Äù: skinny jeans and a white T-shirt that, upon closer inspection, bears a Saint Laurent logo and probably costs a small fortune. She leads a jet-set life and works in the most extrovert of industries, but remains notoriously private and uncomfortable with attention. She fiddles anxiously with her necklace as we talk, avoiding too much eye contact. Having to be trailed by bodyguards as a teenager, having all eyes on her while her would-be kidnappers were arrested and, eventually, sentenced to several years in jail , must have been mortifying.
But Gainsbourg spent her childhood in the public eye, with a mother who epitomised 60s cool and a father whose provocative and often alcohol-soaked antics often made headlines . There was the time he appeared with Whitney Houston on primetime TV and announced that he wanted ‚Äúto fuck her‚Äù, for example. On another live TV show, he burned a 500 franc note to protest against what he considered excessive taxation. Gainsbourg‚Äôs classmates didn‚Äôt respond very kindly to that stunt. ‚ÄúAt school, the kids took my worksheet and they burned it,‚Äù she says. She laughs quietly. ‚ÄúSo I did get‚Ä¶ I did get bullied.‚Äù

Her father died of a heart attack in 1991, when Gainsbourg was just 19. She still seems to worship him and says she misses being ‚Äúable to ask him all the questions about music that I have today‚Äù. She speaks fondly of the way he used to come up with melodies and test them on a little focus group consisting of her, her mother, and his artistic director. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd make little asterixes next to the melodies we preferred,‚Äù she remembers. ‚ÄúEven though I was just a kid, he wanted my point of view.‚Äù
When she was 12, Gainsbourg made her musical debut alongside him on the song Lemon Incest ‚Äì a play on un zeste de citron (a lemon zest). In the infamous video, Gainsbourg is sprawled on a bed while her topless dad caresses her and sings about the love they will never make together. The song, recorded in 1984, was accused of glamorising abuse and paedophilia, but despite the scandal ‚Äì or perhaps because of it ‚Äì Lemon Incest peaked at No 2 in the French charts.

Gainsbourg has spent decades fielding questions about Lemon Incest and is less than thrilled when I ask her whether something similar could be released today, let alone spend 10 weeks in the Top 10, in the era of #MeToo. ‚ÄúIt was already shocking at the time,‚Äù she says with faint exasperation. ‚ÄúI remember my father having to explain himself, and his lyrics, because he plays with the jeu de mots , how do you say that? When you play with the sounds of the words, like a double meaning?‚Äù Gainsbourg is bilingual, but French is her first language; she pauses occasionally in our conversation to search around for le mot juste . We settle on ‚Äúpun‚Äù and she continues. ‚ÄúIncest is so shocking and so taboo. It‚Äôs as if he was amusing himself with that. But when you listen to the lyrics, he‚Äôs just talking about the infinite love of a father for his daughter and of a daughter for her father ‚Äì and you can‚Äôt condemn that. Because there‚Äôs nothing physical. So, yes, he says incest, but that‚Äôs it. I find it terrible that you can‚Äôt talk about things that are‚Ä¶‚Äù she trails off, searching around for the right word. ‚ÄúDifficult?‚Äù I suggest. ‚ÄúNuanced?‚Äù She shrugs. ‚ÄúYou hear the word ‚Äòincest‚Äô and conversation gets shut off,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no dialogue.‚Äù
Social media has made it harder, I suggest: you can imagine the Twitter storms Lemon Incest would provoke today. ‚ÄúYes, but I think my father would be condemned in every move he made,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverything now is so politically correct. So boring. So expected. And everyone is so scared of what will happen if they go too far.‚Äù Men, in particular, she says, have reason to be scared. ‚ÄúA few tweets and it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ their career is over.‚Äù Her dad, she says, would have been miserable today, ‚Äúbecause it did matter to him what people felt, what people thought, when he got criticised‚Äù. He is known as a provocateur, but he was sensitive, Gainsbourg says. ‚ÄúHe got very wounded by a lot of stuff. There were a lot of antisemitic things going on during his life.‚Äù And not just during the war, she adds, when, as a 10-year-old in Nazi-occupied France, he was forced to wear a yellow star to mark him as a Jew. ‚ÄúEven afterwards, France was still very antisemitic.‚Äù So much so that, when Serge Gainsbourg released a reggae version of the Marseillaise (a characteristic provocation) in 1979, one newspaper critic accused him of bringing antisemitism upon himself, by ‚Äútrying to make money with the national anthem‚Äù.
Still, Gainsbourg says brightly, she had a ‚Äúcompletely normal and very simple childhood‚Äù. She was born in London, but grew up in Paris. Apart from regular ferry trips to England to see her maternal grandparents, the family travelled little; her father was scared of planes. Her parents split up when she nine, but Gainsbourg remained close to both, as well as her half-sister Kate Barry, the late fashion photographer (Birkin‚Äôs first daughter, with the English composer John Barry). All in all, she says, life ‚Äúwas very square‚Äù.
Von Trier pushes you into really dark places. I want someone to push me where it‚Äôs difficult, where I‚Äôm uncomfortable
These days, Gainsbourg seems drawn to square pegs in round holes: men like her father who are both outsiders and insiders, who use outrage as a weapon against a society in which they have never felt welcome. Some might call them provocateurs, others perverts. One of her most notable collaborators is the Danish film director Lars von Trier , whose dark, psychological films Gainsbourg has appeared in ‚Äì Nymphomaniac , Antichrist and Melancholia ‚Äì reflect his battles with alcoholism, depression and various phobias. (Like Gainsbourg‚Äôs father, Von Trier is terrified of flying.) In Von Trier‚Äôs films, these battles are often acted out violently on Gainsbourg‚Äôs body: in Antichrist, she plays a grieving mother who cuts off her clitoris with a pair of scissors; in Nymphomaniac, her character has graphic sex with strangers.
Gainsbourg has often been called Von Trier‚Äôs ‚Äúmuse‚Äù ‚Äì but that is too passive a word to describe the actor. Part of her allure is that as a performer she is impossible to categorise neatly. She is not a stereotypical sex symbol or a damsel in distress, and she is not just an instrument for older men to act out their provocations; she uses them just as much as they use her. In all of her parts, you get the sense that she is the one in control.

Von Trier‚Äôs films have frequently been described as misogynistic, but Gainsbourg rejects that idea, saying that she has done some of her best work with him. ‚ÄúHe gives such wonderful parts to women,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHow can he be misogynistic if he‚Äôs portraying women like that?‚Äù What about Bj√∂rk , I ask, who starred in his film Dancer In The Dark ? In 2017, as #MeToo started to become a mainstream movement, Bj√∂rk claimed that she had been sexually harassed by an unnamed film director many assumed to be Von Trier. He denied the allegations.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true Von Trier pushes you into really dark places,‚Äù Gainsbourg says. ‚Äú[But] that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for in acting ‚Äì I want someone to push me places where I haven‚Äôt been, where it‚Äôs difficult, where I‚Äôm uncomfortable. That‚Äôs all I want. For me, a lot of the work is letting go and trusting him all the way.‚Äù While she won‚Äôt speak for Bj√∂rk, she feels her own trust in Von Trier was never betrayed. In Antichrist and Nymphomaniac, for example, he walked through every frame with her to make sure she was comfortable. ‚ÄúI said, the only thing I‚Äôm really uncomfortable with are my boobs. So he said OK, and I‚Äôm wearing a T-shirt the whole time [in the sex scenes]. I trusted him.‚Äù

Gainsbourg released her first album, Charlotte For Ever, when she was 15, then took a long hiatus from music. She didn‚Äôt release anything new until 5:55 in 2006, which sold well and had favourable reviews . She has kept going ever since, exploring a cinematic strain of disco pop, close in spirit to Goldfrapp. While working on her most recent album, 2017‚Äôs Rest , she asked French novelist and provocateur, Michel Houellebecq , if he would write the lyrics. When I bring this up, she looks puzzled. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù ‚ÄúHouellebecq,‚Äù I repeat, in my best French accent. ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù she says, finally, ‚ÄúHouellebecq! Yes, my producer [S√©bastien Akchot√©] and I had the same passion for his genius. My record company did ask him, but he wasn‚Äôt very interested. Anyway, then I realised that I wanted to write the lyrics myself. I do love other people‚Äôs writing. I feel very lucky to have worked with Jarvis Cocker and Beck. But it‚Äôs so different to write your own lyrics. Touring and being on stage had a purpose. It changed everything.‚Äù
Gainsbourg and Attal are not married. 'It was never a goal. My mother got married and it was not a success'
Rest is one of her rawest and most personal albums, and a lot of it stems from grief. In December 2013, her half-sister Kate died after falling from a fourth-floor window in Paris. Her death made living in Paris unbearable, Gainsbourg says. A few months after the tragedy, she decamped to New York with her partner and their three children. ‚ÄúI was coming from a very dark place,‚Äù she says. In the US, ‚ÄúI was breathing again and seeing new sky. I thought: how come I haven‚Äôt done this before? It‚Äôs wonderful to just take a bag and go somewhere else.‚Äù
The anonymity of New York wasn‚Äôt just cathartic; it was creatively liberating. ‚ÄúHere, I feel I‚Äôm being myself with nobody noticing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not noticing. I feel very different, because I‚Äôm not looking at myself all the time. I don‚Äôt think in France I could have released my album and written the lyrics myself.‚Äù The album, which blends French and English, reflects on everything from motherhood to the loss of her sister. On Kate, she sings: ‚Äú On d‚Äôvait vieillir ensemble [we were going to grow old together].‚Äù

In France, Gainsbourg is recognised wherever she goes and is known, first and foremost, as the daughter of Birkin and Serge. In New York, she is finally starting to break free from that history. ‚ÄúI feel ashamed saying this, but when people recognise me here it‚Äôs about me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe films I‚Äôve done, a lot of Lars‚Äôs films, and my music. I don‚Äôt get recognised that often, but when it happens I‚Äôm really proud.‚Äù
At this point, a stocky man, dressed neatly in black, walks in and starts addressing her in French. I assume it is an adoring fan, but it is her partner, the French-Israeli actor and director Yvan Attal. After a second, he apologises to me for being rude and continues in English ‚Äì he just wants a quick word about their lunch plans. The quick word is had and he disappears, presenting the perfect opportunity to start talking about him behind his back.

Gainsbourg has been with Attal for 27 years ‚Äì they met when she was 19 ‚Äì but they are not married. ‚ÄúIt was never a goal,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúOn the contrary. My mother got married [to John Barry, before her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg] and it was not a success. So I felt that it wasn‚Äôt part of my plans. And Yvan, he didn‚Äôt care at all. Later on, we felt that for the children maybe it would be nice for them, for me to have the same name ‚Äì but then I became so superstitious. I‚Äôve heard of a lot of couples who live a long life together, and they get married and split. I thought it was bad luck.‚Äù
Hang on, I say: if she had chosen to get married, she would have changed her name? ‚ÄúNo, not at all,‚Äù she backtracks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very attached to my name, because of my father. But what‚Äôs funny is that I was registered under Gainsbourg, which was not my father‚Äôs real name. He was called Ginsberg and he changed it for work. On his passport, it was still Ginsberg. When I was 18, I asked to go back to my old name, just to have the same as him. It was such a big deal to go through all the paperwork, but we did it. I‚Äôm very proud of it, because that‚Äôs my story. I feel very close to that past.‚Äù

How does England fit into her story, I ask? She was born in London and her mother is English, but she lived only in France, before moving to New York. ‚ÄúI feel I‚Äôm pretending to be English,‚Äù she says, quickly. ‚ÄúFor a long time [growing up], I was very proud of being French. I had a very thick French accent and I wasn‚Äôt making any effort [to be English]; I was the French cousin. But gradually I wanted to feel part of that world. Now, to French people, I sound totally British ‚Äì to British people, I don‚Äôt. I have this pride in being English, but at the same time there‚Äôs nothing really there. Anytime I go to London, I feel like I don‚Äôt belong.‚Äù The English ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let you in very easily‚Äù, she explains.
Has Brexit made her feel even less English? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI am very proud of my British passport. It is so stupid. It‚Äôs a little booklet, but I cherish it. Maybe it‚Äôs my mother, who transmitted something, some pride in that nationality.‚Äù

She has lived in New York for five years, but says there is a cultural divide she hasn‚Äôt been able to bridge. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to get close to American friends. I feel I don‚Äôt understand them completely. It‚Äôs hard to ‚Äì I feel stupid making generalities, but it‚Äôs so money-oriented. In France, we‚Äôre all about having lunch, dinner. It‚Äôs a real art of life, art de vivre ,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what I love. I love time off.‚Äù In the US, she says, everyone is working all the time. ‚ÄúI feel they pretend that‚Äôs what they want, but they‚Äôre just forced to work all the time.‚Äù
For all this, Gainsbourg admits that she is a workaholic herself. She has released five albums and been in more than 40 movies; her latest is a French comedy called My Dog Stupid, directed by Attal and featuring her son, 22-year-old Ben (her daughters, Alice, 16, and Joe, eight, live with her in New York). She also models, and is the face of Saint Laurent . But while she doesn‚Äôt show any signs of slowing down, she has started to worry that the work will dry up as she gets older.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not at peace with [ageing] at all,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think maybe when I‚Äôm 60 I‚Äôll be at peace with it, because I‚Äôll be an old lady and it‚Äôll show.‚Äù For the moment, she is ‚Äúhoping that I still look young‚Äù, although occasionally she finds herself surprised when she looks in the mirror and sees that ‚ÄúI do have wrinkles‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough,‚Äù she says of getting older in the entertainment industry. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a job where you‚Äôre not supposed to age. The parts get thinner and thinner. The work will become less and less consistent. But, in a way, I‚Äôve already passed that. I had an agent who said: ‚ÄòPast 40, you‚Äôre going downhill,‚Äô which was so depressing.‚Äù
Now she is approaching 50 and still getting parts, still making music. After decades of grappling with the burden of her name, Gainsbourg is starting to consider herself a success in her own right; to feel that it is OK to be proud of herself. She may worry about wrinkles, but she is finally comfortable in her own skin.

143,brexit,Germany told to double payments to Brussels as EU scrambles to replace British billions,"GERMANY could be forced to double its payments to the next European Union budget as Brussels scrambles to replace Britain‚Äôs billions after Brexit. PUBLISHED: 08:28, Wed, Oct 30, 2019 | UPDATED: 10:41, Wed, Oct 30, 2019 0
Berlin faces having to hand over as much ¬£28.5 billion, according to the latest government estimates. The Brussels‚Äô plan has sparked fury in the German capital and four other rich governments who also face massive hikes in their budget contributions. Germany could be hit by a steep 100 percent rise ‚Äì from ¬£13 billion in 2020 to ¬£28.5 billion by 2027 ‚Äì whereas the Netherlands only faces a 50 percent increase.

Under the plan the Dutch government‚Äôs contributions to the EU‚Äôs multi-billion euro coffers would rise from just under ¬£4.5 billion to almost ¬£6.5 billion by 2027.
Angela Merkel last week told EU27 leaders at a summit in Brussels that the European Commission‚Äôs plan would mean Germany would become the biggest per capital contributor to the bloc‚Äôs budget.
Berlin is already the EU‚Äôs biggest contributor on a gross basis.
The German finance ministry said: ‚ÄúDue to Brexit and the Commission‚Äôs proposal to abolish permanent rebate, the financing burden on German would disproportionately rise, in comparison to other member states.‚Äù Germany faces its EU budget contributions being doubled by 2027 to replace UK funds (Image: GETTY) Angela Merkel warned she would block the budget if German loses its rebate (Image: GETTY)
Eurocrats want to increase the size of the bloc‚Äôs long-term budget to 1.11 percent of the EU‚Äôs gross national income to help fill the void left by the UK.
Work on the next budget, which runs from 2021 to 2027, is set to go into overdrive as diplomats and officials attempt to sign off the package in the coming months.
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden are all set to rebel against the proposals and demand that contributions of just one percent of gross national income and permanent rebates must continue after Brexit.
The so-called ‚Äúfrugal five‚Äù are all net contributors to the bloc‚Äôs budgets, meaning they pay more in than they receive back.

Britain is the second biggest net contributor to the EU budget and Brexit will leave a ¬£10 billion blackhole in the bloc‚Äôs finances.
Senior eurocrats have previously warned that Brussels has no ‚Äúplan B‚Äù to plug the extraordinary gap left by the UK.
The European Commission has yet to officially calculate the rise in net contributions of member states, according to a spokeswoman.
She added that the five rebate countries were ‚Äúpaying a lower share of their income to the EU budget than the other member states, despite being among the top eight EU countries in terms of relative prosperity‚Äù.

Under the plans, France faces a less steep increase in its net contributions ‚Äì rising from around ¬£6.4 in 2020 billion to ¬£8.6 billion in 2027.
France would also benefit from Brussels scrapping rebates because Paris is largely forced to foot the bill through a so-called ‚Äúcorrection mechanism‚Äô, which was established by Margaret Thatcher to limit UK farming subsidies to the EU 35 years ago.

144,brexit,Labour Party to blame for Britain not being free from EU TODAY ‚Äì 'It's Remainers fault!',"Britain was officially scheduled to leave the European Union on October 31, but the deadline was pushed back after the Prime Minister was forced to ask for an EU extension by Parliament. The UK is now set to leave the bloc on January 31, and MPs have agreed to hold a general election, after the Prime Minister claimed it was the only way to break the Brexit deadlock. But, in an exclusive Express.co.uk poll, readers have pinned the overall blame on the Labour Party, when asked 'Who do you blame for Britain not leaving the EU today?'
Related articles Trump attacks Theresa May for ignoring advice on 'great Brexit deal' DUP on brink as rival parties circle in key general election seats An impressive 72 percent, 18,166, of votes pointed the finger at the Labour Party for Britain not having left the European Union by now.
Labour‚Äôs current position on Brexit is, if they win the general election, to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU, before putting that back to the British people within six months in the form of a referendum, between their deal and Remain.
The Conservative Party were also forced to take some responsibility for Brexit not yet being delivered, with 18 percent, or 4,415 readers, blaming the Tories.
The next largest category picked by readers was ‚ÄòOther‚Äô, which received 1,268 votes (six percent), while the Lib Dems accounted for four percent, or 1,020 votes.

Furious reader
Meanwhile, 218 readers claimed the Brexit Party were to blame for Britain not being free from the shackles of the EU on Halloween, as 190 participants opted for ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Know‚Äô.
The poll took place between midday on Thursday, October 31, and 9.30pm the same day. 25,277 people took part in the Express.co.uk poll.
Readers were quick to list off who they thought was to blame for Britain no having left the EU yet, with Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, and Remain MPs all targeted.
Quote: : ‚ÄúYou can only blame one person that‚Äôs May. If she had implemented what the people voted for straightaway, no deal, we would be out now. And the EU would be in so much of turmoil they would‚Äôve given us everything we asked. Instead of that, we gave them time to regroup and demolish May.‚Äù

Jo Swinson has demanded Article 50 is revoked (Image: GETTY) Mr Johnson - who pledged the UK would be out by the end of October ""do or die"" - was determined to point the finger of blame at a Parliament dominated by Remain-supporting MPs.
He told reporters during a visit to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge: ""There are just too many people who are basically opposed to Brexit, who want to frustrate it.
""It was the mandate of the people. They voted by a pretty substantial majority to do this and Parliament has simply stood in their way.
""If you vote for us and we get our programme through - which we will because it's oven-ready, it's there to go - then we can be out at the absolute latest by January next year.‚Äù
Brexit news: Which leader has the best Brexit policy? (Image: NC) In response, Mr Corbyn, kicking off Labour's election campaign with a speech in Battersea, south London, said the only way to resolve Brexit was through a second referendum.
He also claimed Mr Johnson had to accept responsibility for his failure to honour the commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign.
Mr Corbyn said: ‚ÄúHe said he would rather be dead in a ditch than delay beyond today. But he has failed. And that failure is his alone.
‚ÄúWe need to take it out of the hands of the politicians and trust the people to have the final say.
""Labour will get Brexit sorted within six months. We'll let the people decide whether to leave with a sensible deal or remain. That really isn't complicated.""

148,brexit,Stormont to be recalled after abortion petition - BBC News,"Stormont to be recalled after abortion petition By Enda McClafferty BBC News NI Political Correspondent 17 October 2019 Share this with Whatsapp Image copyright Getty Images Assembly members are set to return to the Stormont chamber for the first time in nearly three years after 31 members signed a petition triggering a recall. The move was proposed in a last-ditch attempt to stop the reform of Northern Ireland's abortion law. Laws on abortion and same-sex marriage in NI will change unless devolution is restored by Monday, 21 October. So the recall will not affect the impending law changes, as it would need an executive to be appointed too. Abortion guidelines issued as deadline draws near On Thursday, the assembly Speaker Robin Newton wrote to all 90 MLAs informing them that the petition had reached the necessary 30 signatures, meaning the special sitting will take place on Monday. The move had been proposed by Northern Ireland peer Baroness O'Loan, who opposes any reform of the current abortion law. It was supported by campaign group Both Lives Matter, who collected the signatures from 27 DUP MLAs, Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann and his party colleagues Robbie Butler and Roy Beggs, as well as TUV leader Jim Allister. Image copyright Getty Images Confirming the target had been reached, DUP leader Arlene Foster said it will provide an opportunity for MLAs to show their opposition to the proposed law changes. ""Hopefully we will be able to debate the issue on Monday,"" she added. It is not clear if MLAs will be able to debate the abortion law changes as, first, they have to elect a speaker with cross-community support. Sinn F√©in will not be present and the SDLP is still considering its options. Alliance said Monday's sitting was ""all about the denial of rights"" and suggested it would not attend the session, but would instead ""use appropriate opportunities to make our point"". The Speaker said it was likely that the assembly would sit at 12:00 GMT on Monday, but that he would meet with party whips on Friday to confirm details. The legislation that allows Stormont to be recalled in special circumstances is rarely used. 1,000 days without devolution Stormont's power-sharing government collapsed two-and-a-half years ago amid a bitter row about a green energy scheme and Parliament has had to pass some key legislation for Northern Ireland in the interim. The DUP has publicly opposed Westminster legislating over the head of local ministers on abortion reform. However, on Tuesday some questioned the timing of the party's move over the recall petition. In a tweet, Sinn F√©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill described it as ""a pointless political stunt"". Advertisement Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie also dismissed it as a ""stunt"" and argued that it looked like a move by the DUP to claim to voters they had tried to do something in order to placate anti-abortion views. Other Stormont sources believe the strategy is a ""mega deflection"" - an attempt to move the focus on the party from Brexit to something else. The DUP said it has consistently called for the return of Stormont. Independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden told BBC News NI she did not sign the petition, despite speculation she was considering it. She said it specifically related to the abortion matter, rather than the wider issue of devolution not being in place for more than 1,000 days.

150,cryptocurrency,Forty-six attorneys general have joined a New York-led antitrust investigation into Facebook - The Washington Post,"Forty-six attorneys general have joined a New York-led antitrust investigation of Facebook, officials announced Tuesday, raising the stakes in a sweeping bipartisan probe of the tech giant that could result in massive changes to its business practices.
The expanded roster of states and territories taking part in the investigation reflects lingering, broad concerns among the country‚Äôs competition watchdogs that ‚ÄúFacebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers‚Äô choices, and increased the price of advertising,‚Äù New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said in a statement .
The Washington Post first reported on the states‚Äô interest in joining the investigation. Will Castleberry, vice president for state and local policy at Facebook, said in a statement that the company would work ‚Äúconstructively with state attorneys general."" He added, ‚ÄúPeople have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide.‚Äù
AD AD Roughly 40 state attorneys general plan to take part in Facebook antitrust probe
The update on the state inquiry was announced the day before chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was slated to testify on Capitol Hill about Facebook‚Äôs plans for the cryptocurrency Libra , which has triggered concerns from regulators over its potential impact on finances. Lawmakers are also expected to ask questions about the company‚Äôs struggles to protect users‚Äô personal information, as well as about its revelation Monday that accounts originating in Russia sought to manipulate political conversations on its services ahead of the 2020 election.
Antitrust issues are also likely to arise, given the growing national unease with the size and power of Silicon Valley, along with growing fears that the country‚Äôs largest tech companies act in ways that unfairly harm rivals or result in higher prices or worse services for consumers.
Earlier this year, state attorneys general opened a similar bipartisan probe of Google, an investigation that centers on its advertising practices and could easily expand to cover other elements of the company‚Äôs business, officials have said. In Washington, meanwhile, federal antitrust authorities have divvied up Silicon Valley for further scrutiny. The Justice Department is probing Facebook and Google while the Federal Trade Commission has started investigating Facebook and Amazon, people familiar with the probes have said. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)
AD AD New York, 7 other states and D.C. launch antitrust investigation into Facebook
With the state probe of Facebook, the concerns span the full gamut of its sprawling digital empire, including its past struggles to protect consumers‚Äô data and its prior acquisition of two competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp. Initially, New York launched its probe with seven other states and the District of Columbia.
‚ÄúGiven Facebook‚Äôs nearly unprecedented influence in so many sectors of the economy and political process, this bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is committed to ensuring that Facebook is complying with the law and meeting its obligations,‚Äù said Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D), one of the 47 officials now participating in the probe.
Texas attorney general, Google‚Äôs new competition cop, says everything is ‚Äòon the table‚Äô
Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) added, ‚ÄúBy working together, state attorneys general are leading the way in ensuring digital platforms respect consumer privacy and do not engage in anticompetitive behavior.‚Äù

151,cryptocurrency,Facebook exec acknowledges some people won‚Äôt be ‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô using a financial product built by Facebook but says Mark Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt giving up ‚Äî even if it takes decades,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters Despite losing seven key partners including PayPal, Visa and Mastercard last month, Facebook continues to pursue its financial services product, the vice president of that project said on Tuesday. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains committed to building new technology that would allow people to send money over Messenger and WhatsApp, Kevin Weil told attendees at the tech conference Web Summit in Lisbon. He downplayed both the loss of partners and the grilling Zuckerberg endured at Congressional hearing on the topic last month, saying that Zuck expects the process to take years ‚Äî or even decades. Weil also admitted that people may not be ""comfortable"" using a financial product by Facebook at all, which is why Facebook has been trying to enlist partners.
LISBON, Portugal ‚Äî As Facebook faces increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide , US attorneys general and among popular opinion over a long list of scandals , the company is still plowing ahead with its new financial services product.
This is a product that would allow Facebook to handle people's money.
Inside Facebook, the project is called Calibra . Despite what looks like a sea of pushback over the idea, Calibra is full-steam ahead inside of Facebook, the vice president of the project, Kevin Weil, told attendees on Tuesday at Web Summit, one of Europe's largest tech conferences, taking place the first week of November in Lisbon.
Calibra is Facebook's digital wallet that will work with Messenger and WhatsApp to allow people to send money, including the cryptocurrency Libra, as easily as they send a text message, Weil described. Facebook announced the project last summer, along with an open source organization called Libra that would oversee the Libra cryptocurrency. Kevin Weil Brian Ach/Getty The intent of Libra was to involve broad industry support to build an open set of technologies for sending money.
Obviously, people can do this today with apps like Venmo, Zelle and the original, PayPal. But Weil points out, someone using Zelle cannot send money to someone using Venmo.
Facebook hopes to create a new ecosystem around Libra where anyone can build financial products not controlled by any one commercial entity, not even Facebook.
""Some people would not be comfortable using a financial product built by Facebook,"" Weil said. This even though Facebook will not share the data collected by Calibra with the social network part of the business, Weil promised.
But, so far, Libra has had a bumpy start. Over the fall, seven major partners have pulled out including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and travel tech company Booking Holdings.
Weil shrugged off the defectors and pointed out that Libra still has the support of 21 others.
""That's ok,"" Weil said. ""In 18 months this went from an idea to 21 fantastic, committed organizations.""
Weil also said that Calibra continues to have the internal support of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""When Mark commits, he commits.""
Weil said that Zuckerberg believes this project could take years, if not decades, to fully materialize and that it would involve a long road with regulators. Last month Zuckerberg was grilled by members of the US Congress over Libra and Calibra and a host of other issues and said he will not proceed until regulators approve it.
However internally at Facebook, technical work on Calibra is proceeding. Weil said he already has a prototype on his phone. Zuckerberg and the engineers involved with Calibra see this as a project to bring cheaper banking services to the world.
""At Calibra, what drives us is to make financial services available to more people around the world and make them dramatically cheaper,"" Weil said on stage. ""People at Facebook are inspired by the ability to help people all over the world.""

Workers at Britain's financial regulator are pooping on the floor, stealing plants, and verbally abusing staff, according to an internal memo seen by the Evening Standard, a London newspaper.
Georgina Philippou, operating chief of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told staff at the agency's London headquarters that she was ""appalled about the incidents of bad behaviour towards our building and colleagues.""
Other bad behaviour includes ""leaving cutlery and crockery in the kitchen areas, overflowing bins, stealing plants and charging cables from desks, catering and security teams being subject to verbal abuse, colleagues defecating on the floor in toilet cubicles on a particular floor, urinating on the floor in the men's toilets and leaving alcohol bottles in sanitary bins,"" the memo said, according to the Standard.
The FCA is an independent watchdog tasked with policing the UK's finance industry and deals with issues ranging from cryptocurrency to banking. It levies hefty fines on individuals and organizations that break its rules and regulations.
Philippou reportedly said she was ""ashamed"" in the memo, adding that only a ""minority of colleagues"" were guilty of bad behavior.
""You may have heard about some of these behaviours already and I'm sure others will come as a shock,"" she said, according to the Standard.
""I did think long and hard about whether to disclose all these behaviours because they are so distasteful and shameful but keeping quiet has not got us far in terms of changing behaviours. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated here,"" Philippou added.
""We have a duty as an employer to highlight this sort of poor behaviour and our senior management are very clear it is simply unacceptable,"" a spokesperson from the FCA told Business Insider.

153,cryptocurrency,Google Publishes Landmark Quantum Supremacy Claim,"Computing Google Publishes Landmark Quantum Supremacy Claim The company says that its quantum computer is the first to perform a calculation that would be practically impossible for a classical machine Share via Print A Sycamore chip mounted in the printed circuit board during the packaging process. Credit: Google AI Quantum Advertisement
Scientists at Google say that they have achieved quantum supremacy, a long-awaited milestone in quantum computing. The announcement, published in Nature on 23 October, follows a leak of an early version of the paper five weeks ago, which Google did not comment on at the time.
In a world first, a team led by John Martinis, an experimental physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Google in Mountain View, California, says that its quantum computer carried out a specific calculation that is beyond the practical capabilities of regular, ‚Äòclassical‚Äô machines. The same calculation would take even the best classical supercomputer 10,000 years to complete, Google estimates.
Quantum supremacy has long been seen as a milestone because it proves that quantum computers can outperform classical computers, says Martinis. Although the advantage has now been proved only for a very specific case, it shows physicists that quantum mechanics works as expected when harnessed in a complex problem.
‚ÄúIt looks like Google has given us the first experimental evidence that quantum speed-up is achievable in a real-world system,‚Äù says Michelle Simmons, a quantum physicist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
Martinis likens the experiment to a ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô programme, which tests a new system by instructing it to display that phrase; it‚Äôs not especially useful in itself, but it tells Google that the quantum hardware and software are working correctly, he says.
The feat was first reported in September by the Financial Times and other outlets, after an early version of the paper was leaked on the website of NASA, which collaborates with Google on quantum computing, before being quickly taken down. At that time, the company did not confirm that it had written the paper, nor would it comment on the stories.
Although the calculation Google chose‚Äîchecking the outputs from a quantum random-number generator‚Äîhas limited practical applications, ‚Äúthe scientific achievement is huge, assuming it stands, and I‚Äôm guessing it will‚Äù, says Scott Aaronson, a theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.
Researchers outside Google are already trying to improve on the classical algorithms used to tackle the problem, in hopes of bringing down the firm‚Äôs 10,000-year estimate. IBM, a rival to Google in building the world‚Äôs best quantum computers, reported in a preprint on 21 October that the problem could be solved in just 2.5 days using a different classical technique. That paper has not been peer reviewed. If IBM is correct, it would reduce Google‚Äôs feat to demonstrating a quantum ‚Äòadvantage‚Äô‚Äîdoing a calculation much faster than a classical computer, but not something that is beyond its reach. This would still be a significant landmark, says Simmons. ‚ÄúAs far as I‚Äôm aware, that‚Äôs the first time that‚Äôs been demonstrated, so that‚Äôs definitely a big result.‚Äù Quick solutions
Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way from classical machines: a classical bit is either a 1 or a 0, but a quantum bit, or qubit, can exist in multiple states at once. When qubits are inextricably linked, physicists can, in theory, exploit the interference between their wave-like quantum states to perform calculations that might otherwise take millions of years.
Physicists think that quantum computers might one day run revolutionary algorithms that could, for example, search unwieldy databases or factor large numbers‚Äîincluding, importantly, those used in encryption. But those applications are still decades away. The more qubits are linked, the harder it is to maintain their fragile states while the device is operating. Google‚Äôs algorithm runs on a quantum chip composed of 54 qubits, each made of superconducting loops. But this is a tiny fraction of the one million qubits that could be needed for a general-purpose machine.
The task Google set for its quantum computer is ‚Äúa bit of a weird one‚Äù, says Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park. Google physicists first crafted the problem in 2016, and it was designed to be extremely difficult for an ordinary computer to solve. The team challenged its computer, known as Sycamore, to describe the likelihood of different outcomes from a quantum version of a random-number generator. They do this by running a circuit that passes 53 qubits through a series of random operations. This generates a 53-digit string of 1s and 0s‚Äîwith a total of 253 possible combinations (only 53 qubits were used because one of Sycamore‚Äôs 54 was broken). The process is so complex that the outcome is impossible to calculate from first principles, and is therefore effectively random. But owing to interference between qubits, some strings of numbers are more likely to occur than others. This is similar to rolling a loaded die‚Äîit still produces a random number, even though some outcomes are more likely than others.
Sycamore calculated the probability distribution by sampling the circuit‚Äîrunning it one million times and measuring the observed output strings. The method is similar to rolling the die to reveal its bias. In one sense, says Monroe, the machine is doing something scientists do every day: using an experiment to find the answer to a quantum problem that is impossible to calculate classically. The key difference, he says, is that Google‚Äôs computer is not single-purpose, but programmable, and could be applied to a quantum circuit with any settings.
Verifying the solution was a further challenge. To do that, the team compared the results with those from simulations of smaller and simpler versions of the circuits, which were done by classical computers‚Äîincluding the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Extrapolating from these examples, the Google team estimates that simulating the full circuit would take 10,000 years even on a computer with one million processing units (equivalent to around 100,000 desktop computers). Sycamore took just 3 minutes and 20 seconds.
Google thinks their evidence for quantum supremacy is airtight. Even if external researchers cut the time it takes to do the classical simulation, quantum hardware is improving‚Äîmeaning that for this problem, conventional computers are unlikely to ever catch up, says Hartmut Neven, who runs Google‚Äôs quantum-computing team. Limited applications
Monroe says that Google‚Äôs achievement might benefit quantum computing by attracting more computer scientists and engineers to the field. But he also warns that the news could create the impression that quantum computers are closer to mainstream practical applications than they really are. ‚ÄúThe story on the street is ‚Äòthey‚Äôve finally beaten a regular computer: so here we go, two years and we‚Äôll have one in our house‚Äô,‚Äù he says.
In reality, Monroe adds, scientists are yet to show that a programmable quantum computer can solve a useful task that cannot be done any other way, such as by calculating the electronic structure of a particular molecule‚Äîa fiendish problem that requires modelling multiple quantum interactions. Another important step, says Aaronson, is demonstrating quantum supremacy in an algorithm that uses a process known as error correction‚Äîa method to correct for noise-induced errors that would otherwise ruin a calculation. Physicists think this will be essential to getting quantum computers to function at scale.
Google is working towards both of these milestones, says Martinis, and will reveal the results of its experiments in the coming months.
Aaronson says that the experiment Google devised to demonstrate quantum supremacy might have practical applications: he has created a protocol to use such a calculation to prove to a user that the bits generated by a quantum random-number generator really are random. This could be useful, for example, in cryptography and some cryptocurrencies, whose security relies on random keys.
Google engineers had to carry out a raft of improvements to their hardware to run the algorithm, including building new electronics to control the quantum circuit and devising a new way to connect qubits, says Martinis. ‚ÄúThis is really the basis of how we‚Äôre going to scale up in the future. We think this basic architecture is the way forward,‚Äù he says.

154,cryptocurrency,"Google's next big thing is offering to be your personal bank (GOOG, GOOGL)","Justin Sullivan/Getty Google is entering new territory: the world of banking. The tech giant is creating checking accounts in partnership with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union as part of a project codenamed Cache, which is expected to launch next year, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday morning . Unlike Apple's credit card ‚Äî which is intentionally branded first and foremost as an Apple product over its financial backer Goldman Sachs ‚Äî the Google checking account is expected to carry Citigroup branding. ""Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,"" the Google executive Caesar Sengupta told The Journal. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
Forget about searching the web ‚Äî Google's next big thing is far less revolutionary: banking.
More specifically, Google is looking to create checking accounts in partnership with Citigroup, the parent company of Citibank, and the Stanford Federal Credit Union.
The project, codenamed Cache, is scheduled to launch to the public next year, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday morning . Unlike Apple's credit card , which prominently featured Apple branding with only a small logo for its financial backer, Goldman Sachs, on the back of the physical card, the Google checking account will look and act like a standard Citibank checking account.
""Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,"" the Google executive Caesar Sengupta told The Journal . The Apple Card, from Apple and Goldman Sachs, carries prominent Apple branding. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider
No other details about the partnership between Google and Citigroup or how the checking account will work were available ‚Äî representatives from Google didn't respond to a request for comment as of publishing. Citigroup representatives confirmed the deal but declined to offer further details. Stanford Federal Credit Union did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It's unclear whether Google will charge fees for its checking accounts ‚Äî Google has yet to decide, it told The Journal. Similar to Apple's approach with the Apple Card integrated directly into the iPhone's Wallet app and Apple Pay, Google plans for users to access its checking accounts through Google Pay. And the company is open to adding more banks in the future, according to The Journal.
Like Facebook's attempted foray into financial services with its Calibra and Libra cryptocurrency projects, Google could face an uphill regulatory battle over its attempt to enter the financial market.
The company has faced increasing scrutiny from state and federal regulators over potential antitrust violations, with both the Department of Justice and a group of state attorneys general looking into the tech giant. And just this week, federal regulators opened an inquiry into Google over its partnership with the hospital system Ascension.
Google provides many of its main services ‚Äî Search, Maps, Gmail, and Photos ‚Äî free in exchange for user data. Unlike with those services, Google says it doesn't use Google Pay data the same way.

The company ‚Äúis aware of the isolated situations and communicating directly with customers,‚Äù according to a spokesperson. Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories . Robinhood Markets‚Äô app has a bug that allowed users to trade with an unlimited amount of borrowed cash, creating what one user called an ‚Äúinfinite money cheat code.‚Äù The bug was first uncovered by members of the WallStreetBets sub-reddit. A Monday post showed user MoonYachts exploiting the glitch to turn a $4,000 stake into a $1 million position. He laid out how he pulled off the trades through the ‚Äúfree money cheat,‚Äù and told other users ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT DO THIS.‚Äù Here‚Äôs how the typically-unauthorized trade works: Users who pay a premium for Robinhood Gold sell call options with money borrowed in the app. Robinhood incorrectly adds the value of the options sold to the user‚Äôs cash pile. This gives the user more capital to trade with, and the more a user borrows, the more the app adds to their buying power. There seems to be no limit to how much a user can exploit the trick. Robinhood is ‚Äúaware of the isolated situations and communicating directly with customers,‚Äù spokesperson Lavinia Chirico said in an emailed statement. The company didn‚Äôt comment on when the bug would be fixed, and users will most likely not see their gains realized once a solution is applied. The traders using the bug could be held liable for their cash and guilty of securities fraud, Georgetown University professor Donald Langevoort told Bloomberg . He added that the participating users may need to ‚Äúfollow the basic law of restitution‚Äù and pay back the borrowed cash. ‚ÄúIf you take advantage of someone‚Äôs mistake to line your own pockets, you need to pay them back,‚Äù he said.

156,cryptocurrency,AOC to Mark Zuckerberg: ‚ÄúYou Would Say White Supremacist-Tied Publications Meet a Rigorous Standard for Fact-Checking?‚Äù,"The Facebook CEO had a tough time answering why a white supremacist-affiliated website fact-checking for the social networking site. By October 23, 2019 Mandel Ngan / AFP / Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress under familiar circumstances: He had been called upon to answer for a sketchy-sounding extension of the social media giant. And legislators had some tough questions for him.
https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1187098428737753091
In this particular case, Zuckerberg was in Washington, D.C. to discuss Libra, Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency. Zuckerberg's goal was to convince a members of the House Financial Services Committee that the same company that's committed a litany of serious privacy breaches could be trusted to run digital currency too. Zuckerberg promised to wait on launching Libra until it was fully backed by U.S. regulators, but ominously warned that ""If America doesn‚Äôt innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed,‚Äù an allusion to China's rumored impending foray into state-run cryptocurrency.
In her line of questioning for Zuckerberg, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez opened by tying the debate about the merits of Libra's existence to Facebook's egregious errors, self-admitted mistakes, and potential crimes . She first grilled Zuckerberg about ""what year and month"" he ""first became aware of Cambridge Analytica"" , a scandal that earned the Facebook co-founder a previous congressional scolding. Zuckerberg wasn't sure.
But the majority of her time was committed to Facebook's hands-off approach to fact-checking political ads, an issue that's come under fire from the right and the left for radically differing reasons. The most telling moments of their exchange came when Ocasio-Cortez invoked Zuckerberg‚Äîand Facebook‚Äîpalling around with white supremacists on separate occasions. She first brought up a recent Politico report that Zuckerberg ""has been hosting informal talks and small, off-the-record dinners with conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican lawmaker in recent months to talk about issues like free speech and discuss partnerships.""
Ocasio-Cortez cut to the chase with a little more gusto (and accuracy) than that politically neutral language, pressing Zuckerberg on his hangouts with ""far-right figures, some of whom have advanced the conspiracy theory that white supremacy is a hoax."" Zuckerberg couldn't muster a response, instead waiting out the clock until AOC‚Äîlimited to five minutes‚Äîpivoted elsewhere. She wanted to squeeze in one more fastball, as seen below:
Ocasio-Cortez: Can you explain why you named The Daily Caller, a publication with well-documented ties to white supremacists, as an official fact-checker for Facebook?
Zuckerberg: Congresswoman, sure. We actually don't appoint the independent fact-checkers. They go through an independent organization called the Independent Fact-Checking Network that has a rigorous standard for who they allow to serve as a fact-checker.
Ocasio-Cortez: So you would say white supremacist-tied publications meet a rigorous standard for fact-checking?
Zuckerberg: Congresswoman, I would say that we're not the one assessing that standard. The International Fact-Checking Network is the one setting that standard.
Zuckerberg, who accidentally employs ""independent"" and ""international"" interchangeably in citing the fact-checking network that Facebook uses, is presumably referring to the latter, which actually exists, rather than the former, which does not. He's implying that the International Fact-Checking Network, which is actually overseen by Poynter, exclusively made the decision to include the Daily Caller in Facebook's fact-checking efforts. It's true that Poynter lists the Daily Caller as an accredited publication (which raises other questions about the group's vetting process), but Facebook itself handpicks the already-accredited publications it wants to include for fact-checking. That's according to the Wall Street Journal, which also reported in December 2018 that Zuckerberg himself was not an innocent bystander in this selection process: ",2019-10-24T02:26:00.000+03:00,gq.com,facebook_ceo|*|tough|*|time|*|answer|*|white_supremacist|*|affiliate|*|website|*|fact_check|*|social|*|networking|*|site|*|october|*|mandel|*|ngan|*|afp|*|chip|*|somodevilla|*|getty_images|*|wednesday|*|facebook_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|appear|*|congress|*|familiar|*|circumstance|*|-pron-|*|answer|*|sketchy|*|sound|*|extension|*|social|*|media|*|giant|*|legislator|*|tough|*|question|*|-pron-|*|particular|*|case|*|zuckerberg|*|washington|*|discuss|*|libra|*|facebook|*|propose|*|cryptocurrency|*|zuckerberg|*|goal|*|convince|*|member|*|house_financial|*|services_committee|*|company|*|commit|*|litany|*|privacy|*|breach|*|trust|*|run|*|digital_currency|*|zuckerberg|*|promise|*|wait|*|launch|*|libra|*|-pron-|*|fully|*|regulator|*|ominously|*|warn|*|america|*|innovate|*|-pron-|*|financial|*|leadership|*|guarantee|*|allusion|*|china|*|rumor|*|impending|*|foray|*|state|*|run|*|cryptocurrency|*|-pron-|*|line|*|question|*|zuckerberg|*|representative|*|alexandria_ocasio|*|cortez|*|open|*|tie|*|debate|*|merit|*|libra|*|existence|*|facebook|*|egregious|*|error|*|self|*|admit|*|mistake|*|potential|*|crime|*|-pron-|*|grill|*|zuckerberg|*|year|*|month|*|-pron-|*|aware|*|cambridge_analytica|*|scandal|*|earn|*|facebook|*|co_founder|*|previous|*|congressional|*|scolding|*|zuckerberg|*|sure|*|majority|*|-pron-|*|time|*|commit|*|facebook|*|hand|*|approach|*|fact_check|*|political_ad|*|issue|*|come|*|fire|*|right|*|left|*|radically|*|differ|*|reason|*|tell|*|moment|*|-pron-|*|exchange|*|come|*|ocasio_cortez|*|invoke|*|zuckerberg|*|facebook|*|palling|*|white_supremacist|*|separate|*|occasion|*|-pron-|*|bring|*|recent|*|politico|*|report|*|zuckerberg|*|host|*|informal|*|talk|*|small|*|record|*|dinner|*|conservative|*|journalist|*|commentator|*|republican|*|lawmaker|*|recent|*|month|*|talk|*|issue|*|like|*|free_speech|*|discuss|*|partnership|*|ocasio_cortez|*|cut|*|chase|*|little|*|gusto|*|accuracy|*|politically|*|neutral|*|language|*|press|*|zuckerberg|*|-pron-|*|hangout|*|far_right|*|figure|*|advance|*|conspiracy_theory|*|white|*|supremacy|*|hoax|*|zuckerberg|*|muster|*|response|*|instead|*|wait|*|clock|*|aoc|*|limit|*|minute|*|pivot|*|-pron-|*|want|*|squeeze|*|fastball|*|ocasio_cortez|*|-pron-|*|explain|*|-pron-|*|daily|*|caller|*|publication|*|document|*|tie|*|white_supremacist|*|official|*|fact|*|checker|*|facebook|*|zuckerberg|*|congresswoman|*|sure|*|-pron-|*|actually|*|appoint|*|independent|*|fact|*|checker|*|-pron-|*|independent|*|organization|*|independent|*|fact|*|checking|*|network|*|rigorous|*|standard|*|-pron-|*|allow|*|serve|*|fact|*|checker|*|ocasio_cortez|*|-pron-|*|white_supremacist|*|tie|*|publication|*|meet|*|rigorous|*|standard|*|fact|*|checking|*|zuckerberg|*|congresswoman|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|assess|*|standard|*|international|*|fact|*|checking|*|network|*|set|*|standard|*|zuckerberg|*|accidentally|*|employ|*|independent|*|international|*|interchangeably|*|cite|*|fact_check|*|network|*|facebook|*|use|*|presumably|*|refer|*|actually|*|exist|*|-pron-|*|imply|*|international|*|fact|*|checking|*|network|*|actually|*|oversee|*|poynter|*|exclusively|*|decision|*|include|*|daily|*|caller|*|facebook|*|fact_check|*|effort|*|-pron-|*|true|*|poynter|*|list|*|daily|*|caller|*|accredit|*|publication|*|raise|*|question|*|group|*|vetting|*|process|*|facebook|*|-pron-|*|handpick|*|accredit|*|publication|*|-pron-|*|want|*|include|*|fact|*|checking|*|accord|*|wall_street|*|journal|*|report|*|december|*|zuckerberg|*|-pron-|*|innocent|*|bystander|*|selection|*|process

Shares of Facebook traded as much as 4.4% lower on Tuesday as an antitrust probe led by New York Attorney General Letitia James expanded to include 47 state attorneys general.

The probe was initially announced in September with the backing of eight states including New York. Watch Facebook trade live .
Facebook's stock price tumbled as much as 4.4% on Tuesday as an antitrust probe led by New York grew to include 47 attorneys general from US states and territories.
The investigation was initially announced in September with the support of eight states including New York. The probe is expected to focus on whether Facebook's handling of consumer data and if the company has engaged in any anti-competitive practices.
""Our investigation now has the support of 47 attorneys general from around the nation, who are all concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, and increased the price of advertising,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement on Tuesday.
The expanded probe comes as Facebook already faces a different antitrust investigation being carried out by the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook also paid the agency a $5 billion fine to settle another probe regarding the social media giant's data privacy practices.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also set to testify on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to answer question's about Libra, the company's cryptocurrency project.

158,cryptocurrency,CBD beverage founder: 'I want to be regulated',"Not nearly enough legislative ink has been spilled over the booming CBD industry, according to Benjamin Witte.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling for regulation, like, I want to be regulated,‚Äù Witte said during an interview during Yahoo Finance‚Äôs monthly Breakouts series. ‚ÄúI think the biggest risk to Recess is kind of bad actors.‚Äù
Witte is CEO and founder of Recess, a CBD ( cannabidiol ) and adaptogens-infused sparkling water brand based in New York. The one-year-old company has raised $6 million in seed funding from as-yet undisclosed investors, and its sunset-colored cans are available in thousands of retail locations on the East Coast and in California. It amassed a backlog of 5,000 orders and did 40 times projected sales in its first month, Witte said (although further financial details haven‚Äôt been disclosed).
But Recess‚Äôs quick surge to consumer packaged goods success hasn‚Äôt been without its roadblocks, with many of these coming as a result of regulatory issues. Recently, Recess had to shift its manufacturing from New York‚Äôs Hudson Valley out-of-state and ‚Äúlay off a bunch of people up there,‚Äù Witte said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an example of the lack of kind of regulatory clarity, very much hampering the industry and forcing us to be very nimble,‚Äù Witte said.
But more ‚Äì not less ‚Äì oversight will ultimately enable the CBD industry to grow, Witte believes.
Recess cans More ‚ÄúCBD right now, it's kind of this mania. I think it has similar dynamics to the cryptocurrency mania where there's this kind of Gold Rush and everyone's trying to start the 2,000th CBD oil company, or there's a new beverage launching every single day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of the people, you know, frankly, launching these companies, don't recognize how challenging it is to create high quality products that are compliant, and so they take shortcuts.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd so when I talk about the regulation being required, I think it's to ensure that the products that are out there are very high quality,‚Äù he added.
The CBD in Recess doesn‚Äôt get users high and is derived from hemp, which contains 0.3% or less of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and was removed from the Drug Enforcement Agency‚Äôs Schedule I classification as part of the Hemp Farm Bill in December 2018. The Food and Drug Administration still considers CBD added to food products to be federally illegal. And while myriad companies and enthusiasts have touted CBD as a solution for everything from anxiety to muscle pain, the science around its efficacy in small doses in consumer products remains inconclusive.
Recess uses 10 milligrams of broad-spectrum hemp extract in each of its 12-ounce cans.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs actually nowhere‚Äô Witte‚Äôs demands for regulation echo those of public cannabis company CEOs, many of whom have cited the black market as a risk to the industry for pulling their customers and undermining the credibility of those who‚Äôve abided by existing legislation. When these leaders call for more regulation, they‚Äôre calling for more clarity ‚Äì for their own operations, consumers and businesses they work with as distributors, retailers and financial service providers.
That cause has been a point of both personal and business interest for Witte. He‚Äôs on the Hemp Roundtable, a lobbying group that, among other things, helped push for the SAFE Banking Act to pass the House of Representatives in September. If enacted into law, the bill would prohibit regulators from penalizing financial institutions from providing banking services to marijuana-related businesses.
The fuzziness around the legality of CBD has kept a host of companies from Coca-Cola ( KO ) to Pepsi ( PEP ) away from the stuff for now ‚Äì although Witte maintains he‚Äôs had conversations with most of the major players in the beverage space, and that they‚Äôre all interested in getting in once regulatory opacity clears.",2019-11-09T18:43:00.000+02:00,yahoo.com,nearly|*|legislative|*|ink|*|spill|*|booming|*|cbd|*|industry|*|accord|*|benjamin|*|witte|*|-pron-|*|regulation|*|like|*|-pron-|*|want|*|regulate|*|witte|*|interview|*|yahoo_finance|*|monthly|*|breakouts|*|series|*|-pron-|*|think|*|big|*|risk|*|recess|*|kind|*|bad|*|actor|*|witte|*|ceo|*|founder|*|recess|*|cbd|*|cannabidiol|*|adaptogen|*|infuse|*|sparkle|*|water|*|brand|*|base|*|new_york|*|year_old|*|company|*|raise|*|million|*|seed|*|funding|*|undisclosed|*|investor|*|-pron-|*|sunset|*|color|*|available|*|thousand|*|retail|*|location|*|east|*|coast|*|california|*|-pron-|*|amass|*|backlog|*|order|*|time|*|project|*|sale|*|-pron-|*|month|*|witte|*|financial|*|detail|*|disclose|*|recess|*|quick|*|surge|*|consumer|*|package|*|good|*|success|*|-pron-|*|roadblock|*|come|*|result|*|regulatory|*|issue|*|recently|*|recess|*|shift|*|-pron-|*|manufacturing|*|new_york|*|hudson|*|valley|*|state|*|lie|*|bunch|*|people|*|witte|*|-pron-|*|example|*|lack|*|kind|*|regulatory|*|clarity|*|hamper|*|industry|*|force|*|-pron-|*|nimble|*|witte|*|oversight|*|ultimately|*|enable|*|cbd|*|industry|*|grow|*|witte|*|believe|*|recess|*|cbd|*|right|*|-pron-|*|kind|*|mania|*|-pron-|*|think|*|-pron-|*|similar|*|dynamic|*|cryptocurrency|*|mania|*|kind|*|gold|*|rush|*|try|*|start|*|cbd|*|oil|*|company|*|new|*|beverage|*|launch|*|single|*|day|*|-pron-|*|lot|*|people|*|-pron-|*|know|*|frankly|*|launch|*|company|*|recognize|*|challenging|*|-pron-|*|create|*|high_quality|*|product|*|compliant|*|-pron-|*|shortcut|*|-pron-|*|talk|*|regulation|*|require|*|-pron-|*|think|*|-pron-|*|ensure|*|product|*|high_quality|*|-pron-|*|add|*|cbd|*|recess|*|user|*|high|*|derive|*|hemp|*|contain|*|tetrahydrocannabinol|*|thc|*|remove|*|drug|*|enforcement|*|agency|*|schedule|*|-pron-|*|classification|*|hemp|*|farm|*|bill|*|december|*|food|*|drug|*|administration|*|consider|*|cbd|*|add|*|food|*|product|*|federally|*|illegal|*|myriad|*|company|*|enthusiast|*|tout|*|cbd|*|solution|*|anxiety|*|muscle|*|pain|*|science|*|-pron-|*|efficacy|*|small|*|dose|*|consumer|*|product|*|remain|*|inconclusive|*|recess|*|use|*|milligram|*|broad|*|spectrum|*|hemp|*|extract|*|-pron-|*|-pron-|*|actually|*|witte|*|demand|*|regulation|*|echo|*|public|*|cannabis|*|company|*|ceo|*|cite|*|black|*|market|*|risk|*|industry|*|pull|*|-pron-|*|customer|*|undermine|*|credibility|*|abide|*|exist|*|legislation|*|leader|*|regulation|*|-pron-|*|clarity|*|-pron-|*|operation|*|consumer|*|business|*|-pron-|*|work|*|distributor|*|retailer|*|financial|*|service|*|provider|*|cause|*|point|*|personal|*|business|*|interest|*|witte|*|-pron-|*|hemp|*|roundtable|*|lobbying|*|group|*|thing|*|help|*|push|*|safe|*|banking|*|act|*|pass|*|house|*|representatives|*|september|*|enact|*|law|*|bill|*|prohibit|*|regulator|*|penalize|*|financial|*|institution|*|provide|*|banking|*|service|*|marijuana|*|relate|*|business|*|fuzziness|*|legality|*|cbd|*|host|*|company|*|coca|*|cola|*|ko|*|pepsi|*|pep|*|away|*|stuff|*|witte|*|maintain|*|-pron-|*|conversation|*|major|*|player|*|beverage|*|space|*|-pron-|*|interested|*|regulatory|*|opacity|*|clear
159,cryptocurrency,Twitter bans political ads after Facebook refused to do so,"VIDEO 2:38 02:38 Twitter will no longer take political ads: Jack Dorsey tweets Closing Bell Twitter is axing political ads from its site, CEO Jack Dorsey announced Wednesday.
Twitter's stock dropped more than 1% in after hours trading following the announcement.
The move sets Twitter in stark contrast to Facebook , which has received criticism from lawmakers and its own employees in recent weeks over its policy to neither fact check nor remove political ads placed by politicians. Facebook has argued it should not be the one to make decisions about its users' speech and that politician's speech is newsworthy. Earlier this month, Chinese video app TikTok became the first major social media platform to ban political ads from its platform.
Dorsey explained the company's reasoning behind the decision in a series of tweets.
""A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet,"" Dorsey wrote. ""Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.""
Dorsey said it would be ""not credible"" for Twitter to tell users it's committed to stopping the spread of misinformation while allowing advertisers to target users with political ads just because they've paid Twitter to do so.
Without naming Facebook or its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Dorsey seemed to take a shot at the company's rhetoric around political ads. Zuckerberg has recently been discussing the importance of ""free expression"" in connection to Facebook's political ad policy, like at a Georgetown University event dedicated to that ideal.
In his final tweet on the topic, Dorsey said pointedly, ""This isn't about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.""
In the Georgetown speech , Zuckerberg said Facebook once considered banning political ads as well and that they don't even make up a significant portion of the business. But ultimately, Zuckerberg warned about the difficulty of drawing a line in such a policy and said, ""when its not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.""
Zuckerberg held firm on his political ads policy on Facebook's earnings call , which came about an hour after Dorsey's announcement. Facebook declined to comment, and pointed to Zuckerberg's prepared remarks from the company's earnings call.
Twitter CFO Ned Segal tweeted that the company will see no change to its Q4 guidance based on the change. Like at Facebook, political ad spend on Twitter is a relatively small portion of the business, clocking in at less than $3 million in sales during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, Segal said.
Dorsey addressed the slippery slope theory in his tweets explaining the move, saying Twitter also considered barring only candidate ads, but said issue ads present a way around this. In the end, he said, Twitter decided to ban issue ads as well since the company believed it's unfair to allow everyone but the candidates themselves to buy ads on topics they care about.
This isn't the first time Dorsey has taken a jab at Zuckerberg as the entire tech industry continues to receive mounting scrutiny over its privacy and competitive policies. At an event in New York last week, Dorsey said ""hell no,"" to the question of whether he would join Facebook's new cryptocurrency association, according to The Verge .
Dorsey's announcement was quickly praised by several key Democrats. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter, ""This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world. What say you, @Facebook?""
House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., also said it was a ""good"" step, adding, ""Your move, Google/Facebook."" Cicilline is one of the leaders of the bipartisan House inquiries into Facebook, Google , Amazon and Apple .
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., also applauded Twitter's new policy. Ocasio-Cortez, who questioned Zuckerberg on political ads at a hearing last week as a member of the House Financial Services Committee, tweeted, ""Not allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make.""
 's 2020 presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale called Dorsey's announcement ""a very dumb decision"" in a statement posted to Twitter. Parscale said it was a move to ""silence conservatives,"" even though the policy applies to all political parties.
Borrowing from Zuckerberg's approach, Dorsey made a call for regulation of his industry. But Dorsey's appeal was for ""more forward-looking political ad regulation"" that takes into account the unique capabilities of internet advertising.
Twitter will begin enforcing its new policy on Nov. 22, Dorsey said, after it releases its final policy on Nov. 15.

160,cryptocurrency,JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs reportedly rejected any involvement in Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency because of fears it would be used by criminals (FB),"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify on Libra cryptocurrency before Congress. AP J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs declined involvement in Libra cryptocurrency due to fears it could be used for criminal acts, The Wall Street Journal reported. Libra is Facebook's move into cryptocurrency , which it announced in June. Many of Libra's backers have already dropped out, including Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .
Banks J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs declined Facebook's invitation to join Libra because of worries that cryptocurrency could be used to violate money laundering and sanctions laws, AnnaMaria Andriotis, Peter Rudegair, and Liz Hoffman at The Wall Street Journal reported.
Facebook hoped to launch Libra by June 2020 with over two dozen cofounders and members of the Libra Association, but these plans have been unraveling since the project was announced early this summer.
Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment regarding J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs' involvement.
Lawmakers have had concerns about Facebook moving into the cryptocurrency world, especially after privacy snafus like the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In July, Facebook cryptocurrency chief and former Paypal president David Marcus was questioned about the project by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He promised that the company wouldn't launch Libra until regulators' concerns were addressed. FILE PHOTO: Libra logo in illustration picture Reuters

In July, Rep. Maxine Waters and other lawmakers sent a letter to Facebook calling on the company to stop Libra implementation over ""serious concerns"" about the project. Increased regulatory scrutiny spooked many of the project's backers, and more than a quarter of initial partners have backed out, including PayPal , Mastercard, Visa, and eBay.
These criticisms also come amid worries that Facebook and other big tech companies are monopolies without sufficient competition. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has made breaking up large tech companies a cornerstone of her platform.

161,cryptocurrency,A quick way to tell which companies see the most regulatory risk,"Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg greets members of congress after testifying at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott More President Trump has touted his administration‚Äôs broad effort to cut down on government regulations that he says hold back businesses. Despite the administration‚Äôs moves to lessen regulatory burdens, major public companies still do all they can to minimize the risks to their business models from government intervention. And that means spending millions of dollars lobbying lawmakers and the White House to gain favor.
A look at a company‚Äôs SEC filings, and it‚Äôs easy to see the laundry list of a company‚Äôs risks ( Uber‚Äôs is impressive, for instance ), and how many of them involve laws and policy.
But there‚Äôs a quick shortcut to learn how companies perceive this risk.
‚ÄúIf you want to know which ‚ÄòBig Tech‚Äô company is likely most exposed to regulation, look at how much they spend on lobbying for their perceived risk of legal action,‚Äù said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a recent note to clients. ‚ÄúAmazon and Facebook, for example, have spent the most on lobbying of all companies so far this year at $12.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively.‚Äù
Furthermore, Colas noted, the companies spent a record quarterly sum on lobbying in the third quarter of 2019 ‚Äî and are on pace to top 2018 highs.
Colas‚Äôs co-founder Jessica Rabe dove deeper, noting that it‚Äôs remarkable that tech holds the top two spots, ‚Äúeven higher than a heavily scrutinized pharma industry or a deeply troubled plane manufacturer.‚Äù Northrup Grumman ($11.0 million), United Technologies ($10.5 million) and Boeing ($10.4 million) follow the tech giants. United Technologies made news in the early days of the Trump administration when the president attempted to prevent jobs from being outsourced to Mexico.
The fact that the tech companies are outspending Boeing, whose CEO Dennis Muilenburg testified in front of Congress this week , ‚Äúreflects just how risky these companies perceive their regulatory environment,‚Äù wrote Rabe.
Currently, both Facebook and Google face antitrust investigations. Facebook also faces regulatory scrutiny of Libra, the company‚Äôs blockchain project that has raised the eyebrows of U.S. and global policymakers .
Who is spending big right now? Tech. For an investor or someone looking at how a company is spending, the Center for Responsive Politics‚Äô OpenSecrets.org project organizes public data into who is spending. DataTrek pulled out some of tech‚Äôs biggest lobbyists .
Amazon, which has faced pressure from President Trump, spent $4 million in Q3 2019, which Rabe noted was the most the retail giant had ever paid in DC lobbying in a quarter.
FILE- In this Sept. 5, 2018, file photo an empty chair reserved for Google's parent Alphabet, which refused to send its top executive, is seen before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) More Facebook‚Äôs spending is up 70% for Q3 compared to last year, and it looks as if they will pass their previous record of $12.6 million.
‚ÄúThat Mark Zuckerberg just testified in front of Congress on Facebook‚Äôs Libra cryptocurrency and the company‚Äôs role in American political life (among many other topics) is likely no coincidence,‚Äù said Rabe.
On the other hand, Alphabet, Google's parent company, has spent about half of what it spent last year in the third quarter, and is far behind the pace to hit $21.8 million as it did last year.
""That drop is not because GOOG feels less regulatory pressure, but is more likely due to the company reorganizing their lobbying operations,‚Äù Rabe says. ‚ÄúEven with the reshuffling of its DC operations, Alphabet is still the ninth-highest spender currently on lobbying this year.‚Äù
What it means for investors Datatrek‚Äôs main takeaways are that size of these three companies create potential investment implications across two sectors, communications (Facebook and Google) and consumer discretionary (Amazon). Combined, they make up a significant amount of the S&P 500 index ‚Äî 7.8% in market cap.",2019-10-31T20:35:00.000+02:00,yahoo.com,facebook|*|chairman_and_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|greet|*|member|*|congress|*|testify|*|house_financial|*|services_committee|*|hearing|*|washington|*|october|*|reuters|*|erin|*|scott|*|president_trump|*|tout|*|-pron-|*|administration|*|broad|*|effort|*|cut|*|government|*|regulation|*|-pron-|*|hold|*|business|*|despite|*|administration|*|lessen|*|regulatory|*|burden|*|major|*|public|*|company|*|-pron-|*|minimize|*|risk|*|-pron-|*|business|*|model|*|government|*|intervention|*|mean|*|spend_million|*|dollar|*|lobby|*|lawmaker|*|white_house|*|gain|*|favor|*|look|*|company|*|sec|*|filing|*|-pron-|*|easy|*|laundry|*|list|*|company|*|risk|*|uber|*|impressive|*|instance|*|-pron-|*|involve|*|law|*|policy|*|quick|*|shortcut|*|learn|*|company|*|perceive|*|risk|*|-pron-|*|want|*|know|*|big_tech|*|company|*|likely|*|expose|*|regulation|*|look|*|-pron-|*|spend|*|lobby|*|-pron-|*|perceive|*|risk|*|legal|*|action|*|nicholas|*|colas|*|co_founder|*|datatrek|*|research|*|recent|*|note|*|client|*|amazon|*|facebook|*|example|*|spend|*|lobbying|*|company|*|far|*|year|*|million|*|million|*|respectively|*|furthermore|*|colas|*|note|*|company|*|spend|*|record|*|quarterly|*|sum|*|lobbying|*|quarter|*|pace|*|high|*|colas|*|co_founder|*|jessica|*|rabe|*|dive|*|deeply|*|note|*|-pron-|*|remarkable|*|tech|*|hold|*|spot|*|high|*|heavily|*|scrutinized|*|pharma|*|industry|*|deeply|*|troubled|*|plane|*|manufacturer|*|northrup|*|grumman|*|million|*|united|*|technologies|*|million|*|boeing|*|million|*|follow|*|tech_giant|*|united|*|technologies|*|news|*|early|*|day|*|trump_administration|*|president|*|attempt|*|prevent|*|job|*|outsource|*|mexico|*|fact|*|tech_company|*|outspende|*|boeing|*|ceo|*|dennis|*|muilenburg|*|testify|*|congress|*|week|*|reflect|*|risky|*|company|*|perceive|*|-pron-|*|regulatory|*|environment|*|write|*|rabe|*|currently|*|facebook|*|google|*|face|*|antitrust|*|investigation|*|facebook|*|face|*|regulatory|*|scrutiny|*|libra|*|company|*|blockchain|*|project|*|raise|*|eyebrow|*|global|*|policymaker|*|spend|*|big|*|right|*|tech|*|investor|*|look|*|company|*|spend|*|center|*|responsive|*|politics|*|project|*|organize|*|public|*|datum|*|spend|*|datatrek|*|pull|*|tech|*|big|*|lobbyist|*|amazon|*|face|*|pressure|*|president_trump|*|spend_million|*|rabe|*|note|*|retail|*|giant|*|pay|*|dc|*|lobby|*|quarter|*|file|*|photo|*|chair|*|reserve|*|google|*|parent|*|alphabet|*|refuse|*|send|*|-pron-|*|executive|*|senate|*|intelligence|*|committee_hearing|*|capitol_hill|*|washington|*|ap_photo|*|jose|*|luis|*|magana|*|file|*|facebook|*|spending|*|compare|*|year|*|-pron-|*|look|*|-pron-|*|pass|*|-pron-|*|previous|*|record|*|million|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|testify|*|congress|*|facebook|*|libra_cryptocurrency|*|company|*|role|*|american|*|political|*|life|*|topic|*|likely|*|coincidence|*|rabe|*|hand|*|alphabet|*|google|*|parent|*|company|*|spend|*|half|*|-pron-|*|spend|*|year|*|quarter|*|far|*|pace|*|hit|*|million|*|-pron-|*|year|*|drop|*|goog|*|feel|*|regulatory|*|pressure|*|likely|*|company|*|reorganize|*|-pron-|*|lobbying|*|operation|*|rabe|*|reshuffling|*|-pron-|*|dc|*|operation|*|alphabet|*|ninth|*|high|*|spender|*|currently|*|lobby|*|year|*|-pron-|*|mean|*|investor|*|datatrek|*|main|*|takeaway|*|size|*|company|*|create|*|potential|*|investment|*|implication|*|sector|*|communication|*|facebook|*|google|*|consumer|*|discretionary|*|amazon|*|combine|*|-pron-|*|significant|*|index|*|market|*|cap
162,cryptocurrency,Zuckerberg defends Facebook as bastion of 'free expression' in speech | Technology | The Guardian,"CEO faces quick backlash over highlighted policies, including on hate speech and voter suppression. Mark Zuckerberg touted Facebook as a champion of ‚Äúfree expression‚Äù in a wide-sweeping speech, offering a staunch defense of the social media giant following several rocky years characterized by allegations against the platform of censorship and bias.
Speaking at Georgetown University on Thursday, the Facebook CEO invoked Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr and Black Lives Matter as a means of positioning Facebook as a champion for freedom of speech.
Zuckerberg defended the company‚Äôs decision to allow misinformation in political advertising on the platform, despite high-profile pushback against the policy.
‚ÄúGiven the sensitivity around political ads, I‚Äôve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. ‚ÄúBut political ads are an important part of voice ‚Äì especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.‚Äù
And he also seemed to brazenly rewrite the site‚Äôs beginnings, which were reportedly as a ‚Äúhot or not‚Äù game for Harvard students to play, as a platform to share perspectives after the beginning of the Iraq war.
‚ÄúI remember feeling that if more people had a voice to share their experiences, then maybe it could have gone differently,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThose early years shaped my belief that giving everyone a voice empowers the powerless and pushes society to be better over time.‚Äù
The CEO addressed Facebook‚Äôs attempts to enter the Chinese market, saying the company was unable to overcome China‚Äôs strict censorship. And he seemed to take a swipe at competitor platform TikTok, the Chinese video sharing app recently gaining huge popularity.
‚ÄúI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought maybe we could help creating a more open society,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.
‚ÄúI worked hard on this for a long time, but we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey never let us in.‚Äù
Zuckerberg said the company now has 35,000 people working on platform security and that the company‚Äôs security budget is larger than $5bn ‚Äì greater than the entire company‚Äôs revenue when it went public in 2013.
Zuckerberg‚Äôs address was met with swift, and fierce, criticism.
Not-for-profit organizations pushed back against a number of Facebook policies highlighted on Thursday, including those around hate speech and voter suppression. When discussing discriminatory speech, Zuckerberg repeatedly stressed his commitment to ‚Äúfree expression‚Äù and said he feared ‚Äúpotentially cracking down too much‚Äù.
‚ÄúMark Zuckerberg made clear today that he is not only doubling down on a business model that corrupts our democracy, but also fundamentally lacks an understanding of how civil rights, voter suppression, and racism actually function in this country,‚Äù said Rashad Robinson, the president of digital anti-hate group Color Of Change.
‚ÄúZuckerberg is co-opting civil rights history to justify Facebook policies that undermine our democracy,‚Äù said Vanita Gupta , the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ‚ÄúHard to imagine MLK and Frederick Douglass, who he just invoked, supporting FB‚Äôs move to protect politicians who rely on misinformation and race-baiting for electoral gain.‚Äù
Zuckerberg‚Äôs reference to Facebook as the fifth pillar of democracy drew criticism from journalists. The Facebook CEO represents ‚Äúthe antithesis of free expression‚Äù, said John Stanton, the co-founder of the Save Journalism Project, in a statement.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs thrown pennies at programs to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô journalists that, in actuality, are little more than PR stunts intended to provide cover as he puts countless journalists out of work, strips the industry to the bone, and reaps billions in ad revenue,‚Äù Stanton said.
Facebook‚Äôs policies on allowing misinformation in political advertising have been the subject of intense debate in recent weeks, following the platform‚Äôs refusal to take down a Donald Trump campaign ad that made misleading statements about the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
Facebook has increasingly come under scrutiny as the 2020 elections near, with a number of candidates calling for the breakup of the social media giant.
In an effort to highlight the consequences of the policy, the Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren published her own misleading advertisement on the social media network.
Many of these issues may be addressed when Zuckerberg testifies next week at a congressional hearing over Libra, Facebook‚Äôs new cryptocurrency.
‚ÄúLook, we know we‚Äôre doing a very good job of making everyone angry,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.

163,cryptocurrency,Twitter's Jack Dorsey criticizes Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg - Business Insider,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. REUTERS/Toby Melville Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey didn't hold back his thoughts on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a Twitter event on Thursday. Dorsey took issue with Zuckerberg's comments on free speech. The Twitter cofounder and CEO also slammed Zuckerberg for claiming Facebook was a response to the Iraq War. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .
At the Twitter News Summit on Thursday, CEO Jack Dorsey let loose with his criticisms of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in an interview with BuzzFeed Editor in Chief Ben Smith .
When asked about Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University last week, Dorsey said, ""We talk a lot about speech and expression and we don't talk about reach enough, and we don't talk about amplification. And reach and amplification was not represented in that speech,"" according to the journalist Sarah Frier, who was tweeting from the event .
At Georgetown, Zuckerberg talked about Facebook's decision not to censor political ads and described Facebook as a place that offers "" voice and inclusion ."" Zuckerberg had also tried to recharacterize the founding of Facebook as a reaction to the Iraq War. He said, ""If more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently,"" which was the first time he mentioned this.
Dorsey called him out on this, saying, ""There's some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we're trying to do,"" according to Frier on Twitter. ‚ÄîSarah Frier (@sarahfrier) October 24, 2019
Dorsey, who cofounded Twitter nearly 15 years ago, has not been immune to criticism himself. Critics have blasted Twitter for not sufficiently cracking down on harassment and toxic speech on the platform. And Twitter's hands-off approach to US President Donald Trump, whose inflammatory tweets arguably violate Twitter's terms of use, has damaged Twitter's credibility in the eyes of many.
When asked if he would join Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency association, Dorsey said ""hell no,"" according to the Axios reporter Sara Fischer. ‚ÄîSara Fischer (@sarafischer) October 24, 2019",2019-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00,businessinsider.com,twitter|*|ceo|*|jack_dorsey|*|reuters|*|toby|*|melville|*|twitter|*|ceo|*|jack_dorsey|*|hold|*|-pron-|*|thought|*|facebook_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|twitter|*|event|*|thursday|*|dorsey|*|issue|*|zuckerberg|*|comment|*|free_speech|*|twitter|*|cofounder|*|ceo|*|slam|*|zuckerberg|*|claim|*|facebook|*|response|*|iraq|*|war|*|visit_business|*|insider_homepage|*|story|*|twitter|*|news|*|summit|*|thursday|*|ceo|*|jack_dorsey|*|let|*|loose|*|-pron-|*|criticism|*|facebook_ceo|*|mark_zuckerberg|*|interview|*|buzzfeed|*|editor|*|chief|*|ben|*|smith|*|ask|*|zuckerberg|*|speech|*|georgetown_university|*|week|*|dorsey|*|-pron-|*|talk|*|lot|*|speech|*|expression|*|-pron-|*|talk|*|reach|*|-pron-|*|talk|*|amplification|*|reach|*|amplification|*|represent|*|speech|*|accord|*|journalist|*|sarah|*|frier|*|tweet|*|event|*|georgetown|*|zuckerberg|*|talk|*|facebook|*|decision|*|censor|*|political_ad|*|describe|*|facebook|*|place|*|offer|*|voice|*|inclusion|*|zuckerberg|*|try|*|recharacterize|*|founding|*|facebook|*|reaction|*|iraq|*|war|*|-pron-|*|people|*|voice|*|share|*|-pron-|*|experience|*|maybe|*|thing|*|differently|*|time|*|-pron-|*|mention|*|dorsey|*|-pron-|*|revisionist|*|history|*|-pron-|*|storytelling|*|-pron-|*|away|*|authenticity|*|genuineness|*|-pron-|*|try|*|accord|*|frier|*|twitter|*|sarah|*|frier|*|october|*|dorsey|*|cofounde|*|twitter|*|nearly|*|year_ago|*|immune|*|criticism|*|-pron-|*|critic|*|blast|*|twitter|*|sufficiently|*|crack|*|harassment|*|toxic|*|speech|*|platform|*|twitter|*|hand|*|approach|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|inflammatory|*|tweet|*|arguably|*|violate|*|twitter|*|term|*|use|*|damage|*|twitter|*|credibility|*|eye|*|ask|*|-pron-|*|join|*|libra|*|facebook|*|cryptocurrency|*|association|*|dorsey|*|hell|*|accord|*|axios|*|reporter|*|sara|*|fischer|*|sara|*|fischer|*|october

165,cryptocurrency,Ocasio-Cortez stumps Zuckerberg with questions on far right and Cambridge Analytica | Technology | The Guardian,"Democratic lawmaker challenges Facebook CEO during hearing over Libra cryptocurrency. Mark Zuckerberg faced a grueling examination from the Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday, with questions over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook‚Äôs reluctance to police political advertising.
Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers grilled the Facebook CEO during a hearing in front of the US House of Representatives financial services committee regarding the launch of Facebook‚Äôs cryptocurrency project, Libra.
‚ÄúIn order for us to make decisions about Libra, I think we need to kind of dig into your past behavior and Facebook‚Äôs past behavior with respect to our democracy,‚Äù the New York congresswoman said, before asking Zuckerberg when he had first learned of Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs operations.
How AOC turned boring congressional hearings into electrifying moments Read more
Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have declined to disclose when they found out the company was harvesting and selling user data to influence elections.
Internal Facebook correspondence uncovered in 2019 as part of a lawsuit revealed executives knew of potentially improper data collection by Cambridge Analytica as early as September 2015. The Guardian first reported on the existence of the firm in December 2015.
Zuckerberg claimed on Wednesday that he learned of Cambridge Analytica ‚Äúaround the time [the news] became public ‚Ä¶ around March of 2018‚Äù. Ocasio-Cortez asked if anybody on Zuckerberg‚Äôs leadership team knew about the firm before the report published by the Guardian on 11 December 2015.
‚ÄúI believe some folks were tracking it internally,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. ‚ÄúI do think I was aware of Cambridge Analytica as an entity earlier, but I don‚Äôt know if I was tracking how they were using Facebook specifically.‚Äù
Ocasio-Cortez went on to ask the executive about Facebook‚Äôs policy on exempting political advertising from factchecking, asking if she could pay to advertise an incorrect election date to people in a primarily black zip code, for example.
Zuckerberg said Facebook does support removing content in cases of violence or of census or voter suppression. He did not answer whether the company would take down outright lies if they were in political advertisements.
This month, the company declined to take down a Trump campaign ad that included a misleading portrayal of the former vice-president Joe Biden‚Äôs work in Ukraine.
‚ÄúDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of factchecking on political advertisements?‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez asked.
CSPAN (@cspan) ""So, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that's just a pretty simple yes or no.""

October 23, 2019 She also asked Zuckerberg about his ‚Äúdinner parties with far-right figures‚Äù and if at those meetings he addressed the popular rightwing theory that Facebook cracks down on conservative speech, a question Zuckerberg also dodged.
Zuckerberg‚Äôs testimony marked the first time he has appeared before Congress since April 2018, when he spoke at a hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica. The executive repeatedly acknowledged Facebook‚Äôs mistakes during the questioning on Wednesday.
‚ÄúI get that I‚Äôm not the ideal messenger for this right now. We‚Äôve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,‚Äù he said.

166,cryptocurrency,"'Is that the internet we want?' Zuckerberg blasts China, Tik Tok for censorship","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg blasted China for its censorship in a free speech-focused speech Thursday in which he also defended the company's policy to allow false information in political ads.
‚ÄúThis question of which nation‚Äôs values are going to determine what speech is allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective our debates about the content issues of the day. Because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues ‚Äî we at least can disagree,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.
At an event at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg highlighted the rise of Chinese tech companies and warned China is ‚Äúexporting their vision of the internet to other countries.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile our services like WhatsApp are used by protestors and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok ‚Äî the Chinese app growing quickly around the world ‚Äî mentions of these same protests are censored, even here in the U.S. Is that the internet we want?‚Äù he said.
The CEO said he wanted to offer Facebook in China, but could never come to an agreement on what it would take to operate inside the country.
‚ÄúI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought maybe we could help in creating a more open society,‚Äù said Zuckerberg. ‚ÄúThey never let us in. Now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.‚Äù
Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to address the audience on ""the challenges of protecting free speech while combating hate speech online, fighting misinformation, and political data privacy and security,"" at a forum hosted by Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) and the McCourt School of Public Policy in Washington, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso More In a statement to Yahoo Finance, TikTok denied Zuckerberg‚Äôs claims.
‚ÄúOur content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team and are not influenced by any foreign government. The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there. To be clear: We do not remove videos based on the presence of Hong Kong protest content,‚Äù said a TikTok spokesperson.
Zuckerberg isn‚Äôt the only person to raise concerns about TikTok. Sen. Marco Rubio has asked the U.S. government to investigate the company over censorship fears. In a recent tweet, he also warned parents the app is ‚Äúcollecting personal data on your teens for #China & they are stealing money through copyright theft.‚Äù
In a Q&A session after his prepared remarks, a moderator asked Zuckerberg about what conditions he would be willing to accept in order to do business in China. Zuckerberg said he has ‚Äústruggled‚Äù with that question, but worries about several issues including censorship and data localization in China and other countries.
‚ÄúI would be very worried about localizing people‚Äôs data in a country that doesn‚Äôt have very strong respect for rule of law,‚Äù said Zuckerberg. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where we put people‚Äôs data at that kind of risk.‚Äù

The Reddit geek who raked in more than $100,000 with two trades told Markets Insider he credits his parents for his success, likes tech stocks, and found it hard to walk away with his profits.
Eddie Choi, a 25-year-old business analyst in San Diego, made a splash when Bloomberg reported that he turned $766 into nearly $108,000 by purchasing puts on Roku stock and SPY ‚Äî the S&P 500 exchange-traded fund ‚Äî then profiting enormously when they dropped.
Choi learned how to trade options on WallStreetBets , a subreddit with the tagline ""Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal.""
Markets Insider asked Choi about his background, investment strategy, future plans, and other topics. His answers have been lightly edited and are laid out below. He told us he works at a small bank as a business analyst, and declined to provide a photo or name his place of employment.
Who are you?
I'm Eddie Choi, and I'm 25 years old. I currently live in San Diego, and I work with data at a bank. I grew up with two immigrant parents from Korea, so they had to raise my older brother and me while learning a new culture and language in America.
I credit a lot of my success and who I am to them because they had to work extremely hard to make sure that our family was in a good place financially, emotionally, and physically. Because of how hard they worked, our family is in a good place, and both my brother and I have an amazing opportunity to succeed in America.
My parents always told me to dream big and to never settle, and that's the mentality I've always had.
How did you end up trading options?
I tend to like risk and enjoy learning about higher-risk, higher-reward investments, so that's why I initially learned about options.
I heard about options from WallStreetBets and from friends, and I learned more about how they work by researching it myself. I've tried many things that involve risk, such as trading cryptocurrency, day trading stocks, and gambling for fun at casinos.
What made you think Roku and Spy would be good investments?
Roku went up from $25 to $170 in about 8 months, between late December and early September. It started to drop, and it didn't really recover. I've seen so many stocks drop a lot after going up insane amounts in short amounts of time, so I gambled that Roku was going to drop a lot in the near future.
I still believed in Roku in the long run, so this was just a short-term thing. I invested about $800, and I honestly expected to lose it all, but I knew there was a chance I'd hit it big.
Luckily the next day Roku dropped about 20%, which is insane for a stock with that market cap. To show you how much I gained, an option I bought for $11 was worth $1,350. I had a good handful of options that went up that much in value for Roku.
SPY wasn't as crazy. I only gained 100% whereas I gained 65 times for Roku. I basically just follow the market for SPY, but trading it on a day-to-day basis is really risky because one news drop can dive or raise SPY enough to heavily affect short-term SPY options. There was bad news on the day I bought the SPY puts, so I rode that news and sold shortly after.
Were you worried about the risk you were taking with these trades?
I wasn't as worried about my Roku trade because it was only about $800, but there was more money involved with the SPY trade, so I was more worried about it. I do realize that there will always be risk in investments, so I understand and accept that there's the risk of losing money.
What do you attribute your success to?
I definitely did my research, but with such a short-term option trade, there's definitely luck and timing involved. Any news can cause a stock to go up or go down a lot in value from one day to the next, whereas there's more time for a bounce back when you invest longer term.
What did you learn from your trading success?
I learned that you need to be able to take your winnings. It's tempting to continue to trade when you have such a successful trade, but I had to understand that it's as easy to lose my money as it is was to win the money.
It's also important to not trade emotionally. If you get too emotional about an outcome of a trade, it's probably best to take a break and come back when you have a clearer mind.
What advice would you give to other aspiring investors?
The number one thing I want people to realize is that not everyone will win when it comes to risky investments like options and that there is a lot of risk involved.
I think some people may not realize the risk and may think it's common for people to win a lot of money when they read articles or see stories of people winning huge on investments such as options. But when you're dealing with weekly options, you have to realize that there is a possibility that you will lose all your money invested in the weekly option.
I'd also tell aspiring investors to do their own research. It may be tempting to go on forums or read opinions from others, but I invest based on what I feel is a good investment. I'll obviously read opinions from others, but I try not to invest solely based on what another person says. The best way to be a great investor is to learn the ins and outs yourself.
What was the hardest part about the trades?
The hardest part was definitely walking away with my profits. I ended up walking away with $70,000, but I was tempted to continue to invest in options with that amount, but I had to tell myself that it's probably best to take the profits for now.
What else is on your watchlist? Have any other stocks and indexes caught your eye recently?
I follow a lot of the tech stocks. I like them because they have high market caps, but they are also volatile, so they're great to trade, but the risk is also higher for them.
How do you plan to use your profits?
I'm not sure how I'm going to use my profits as of right now. I'm not doing anything with them, but maybe I'll use them to buy a property or something else in the future.
Do you plan to return to options trading, or quit while you're ahead?
I'm definitely going to trade options again. I decided to take a break for now because I was using so much time to keep up with the market daily, but I do have plans to go back and trade options in the future.
I want to continue to invest for the rest of my life. I'll definitely cut back on the risk as I age and have a family, but I personally believe that investing is a good tool to learn, and I also enjoy learning about it.

169,cryptocurrency,Watch AOC leave Mark Zuckerberg speechless in House hearing,"10.23.19 Watch AOC leave Mark Zuckerberg speechless on the topic of Facebook‚Äôs political ad rules
[Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images] By Harrison Weber 1 minute Read Facebook‚Äôs controversial (yet only mildly interesting) libra cryptocurrency plans brought Mark Zuckerberg before the House Financial Services Committee today, but the chief executive‚Äôs testimony took a startlingly android-y turn during an exchange with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Fielding questions on Facebook‚Äôs advertising policies, Zuckerberg stated that while the company does not allow ‚Äúvoter suppression‚Äù ads, such as an ad that promotes a false election date, Facebook does allow politicians to pay to promote lies‚Äîat least in some scenarios. When pressed by Ocasio-Cortez on whether she could falsely advertise that, say, Republicans supported Green New Deal legislation under Facebook‚Äôs current rules, a fitful Zuckerberg responded that he did not know.
You can watch the full, five-and-a-half-minute exchange via the video embedded below.
""So, you won&apos;t take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that&apos;s just a pretty simple yes or no.""

170,cryptocurrency,Co-founder of Facebook blockchain: Libra ‚Äòabsolutely not‚Äô in jeopardy,"The head of Facebook‚Äôs blockchain project says development of the Libra project will get tougher, but insisted that the departure of seven companies that had originally backed the venture has forced ‚Äúno change‚Äù on the project.
David Marcus, the head of Calibra, told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday that the development of the decentralized blockchain is ‚Äúabsolutely not‚Äù in jeopardy after PayPal ( PYPL ), Visa ( V ), Mastercard ( MA ), Stripe, eBay ( EBAY ), Mercado Pago, and Booking have all decided to leave the project .
‚ÄúYou really have to, as a member, have passion and energy and fortitude to go through this because it‚Äôs hard,‚Äù Marcus said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs going to continue being hard. If anything, it‚Äôs going to get harder before it gets easier.‚Äù
The ambitious project stems from a white paper unveiled in June detailing plans to build a blockchain that will support a ‚Äúlow-volatility‚Äù cryptocurrency called Libra. The currency would be backed by short-term government securities and fiat currency, which users would deposit into the reserve when they exchange their money for units of Libra.
Marcus said he ‚Äúrespect[s]‚Äù the seven companies‚Äô decisions to leave the project and thanked the companies for having ‚Äúthe courage to look at potentially disrupting themselves.‚Äù
Facebook's blockchain lead David Marcus. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier More ‚ÄúBut I also understand that they also have a responsibility to their shareholders and to their stakeholders and they were under a lot of pressure,‚Äù Marcus said, adding that companies outside of the formalized Libra Association council will still be able to offer services on the platform.
On Monday, the Libra Association was formally founded in Geneva, Switzerland with the 21 remaining initial members, including Uber ( UBER ), Lyft ( LYFT ), Coinbase, Spotify ( SPOT ), and Vodafone. Facebook ( FB ) is spearheading Libra‚Äôs development (via its subsidiary, Calibra) but has said decisions regarding the blockchain will be made by the association at large.
In addition to announcing its board of directors (which includes Marcus, in addition to representatives from Andreessen Horowitz, Kiva Microfunds, PayU, and Xapo Holdings), the group on Monday announced that over 1,500 ‚Äúentities‚Äù have indicated interest in joining the group.
The association said 180 entities already met the preliminary membership criteria.
Marcus said now that the association is formal, the next steps will be creating finding ‚Äúmore diversity‚Äù in its membership. Per the white paper, the goal is to have about 100 members of the association by its target launch in the first half of 2020.
Marcus said regulatory matters have not been behind the seven departures from the project, despite commentary from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assuming that ‚Äúsome of the partners got concerned and dropped out‚Äù over rules like anti-money laundering standards.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fleshing out all of the regulatory requirements and oversight required for this to operate but nothing has changed,‚Äù Marcus said.
Marcus said the target launch date in the first half of 2020 is ‚Äúan ambitious timeline that becomes an external forcing function for everyone.‚Äù But he reiterated, as he did to lawmakers in testimony earlier this year, that the project will take its time and wait until it gets regulatory approval before launch.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned a great deal from this process,‚Äù Marcus said.

171,cryptocurrency,HUD Sec. Ben Carson announces initiative to push more bank-originated mortgages,"Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson announced Monday that HUD has reached an agreement with the Department of Justice to ease the handling of False Claims Act cases related to loans for low-income homebuyers.
HUD says the memorandum of understanding is designed to encourage banks to originate more mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Carson said banks have been turned off to originating FHA-insured loans amid a crackdown on banks accused of underwriting FHA-insured loans to borrowers who were not eligible, a violation of the FCA.
‚ÄúAfter the housing crisis, many of the banks were persecuted I would say for relatively minor infractions,‚Äù Carson told Yahoo Finance in an interview on Monday. ‚ÄúSome of them were major infractions, but many of them were minor infractions.‚Äù
Banks used to represent about 45% of lenders originating FHA-insured mortgages as of 2010, HUD says. The agency says banks now represent only 15% of lenders, as non-banks like Quicken Loans have surged to prominence.
UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 22: HUD Secretary Ben Carson, left, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are seen during the House Financial Services Committee hearing titled The End of Affordable Housing? A Review of the Trump Administrations Plans to Change Housing Finance in America, in Rayburn Building on Tuesday, October 22, 2019. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images), More As a non-bank, Quicken Loans is not regulated by the main banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). Quicken Loans, the largest mortgage lender in the U.S., is held by the privately owned parent company Rock Holdings Inc.
Carson said he and HUD ‚Äúvery much appreciate the non-banks‚Äù but said the mortgage lending space should ‚Äúhave a wide group of people who offer credit.‚Äù
The agreement with the DOJ tasks HUD with evaluating each FCA claim, which Carson says will allow his agency to see if the case can be ‚Äúresolved administratively.‚Äù If HUD cannot close the case, it would be referred to the DOJ for investigation.
As originally reported by Politico , HUD will also only refer cases to the DOJ when more than 15 loans show serious violations or if the loan has an unpaid principal balance of at least $2 million and shows ‚Äúsystemic or widespread‚Äù violations.
Several large banks have been docked hefty penalties for FCA claims in the past. In 2014, Bank of America ( BAC ) paid $1 billion to settle an FCA case alleging that it fraudulently sold mortgages that were defective to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That same year, the DOJ and HUD teamed up with the Department of Veterans Affairs to fine JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) $614 million for underwriting non-compliant mortgage loans and submitting them for insurance coverage.
Carson said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide liquidity to the mortgage market by purchasing and packaging mortgages, continue to face their own structural issues as entities under ‚Äúconservatorship.‚Äù During 2008, the federal government bailed out the two entities to keep the mortgage system functioning, but lawmakers have since struggled to find a solution to place both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of conservatorship.
Carson said it is ‚Äúhigh-time‚Äù for both agencies to begin that process, adding that there are plans for an ‚Äúappropriate type of government backstop‚Äù for guarantors that would want to compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
‚ÄúWe would like to capitalize those entities and get them out into the private sector, as well as providing opportunity for other insurers to come into that market,‚Äù Carson told Yahoo Finance.

172,cryptocurrency,We're learning how much big banks are feeling Silicon Valley's pain: Morning Brief,"Wednesday, October 16, 2019
Wall Street lost hundreds of millions on tech unicorns It's been a tough year for some big-ticket IPOs . And now we're starting to see how much these disappointments in the tech space are hitting some big investment banks.
In its third quarter earnings report released Tuesday, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) executives outlined a tough environment for their own investments in some new issues like Uber ( UBER ) as well as its position in The We Company. Revenue in Goldman's equity securities division fell 40% from the prior year, a decline the firm said reflected ""significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities as well as net losses from investments in public equities.""
On an earnings conference call, Goldman CFO Stephen Scherr said the bank‚Äôs mark-to-market hit on its public holdings was $267 million, with most of that coming from its stakes in Uber, Avantor ( AVTR ), and TradeWeb ( TW ).
Scherr also revealed that the company wrote down its stake in WeWork by $80 million. WeWork, which filed to go public in August, subsequently saw its valuation fall precipitously, pulled its IPO, and is now seeking alternative financing arrangements in order to continue as a going concern. Goldman's writedown also follows Jefferies ( JEF ) taking a $146 million hit on its WeWork investment in its earnings report released last month.
JPMorgan ( JPM ), which has been leading efforts to arrange WeWork's latest financing package, was pressed repeatedly on its involvement with the company during a call with the media, but said only that it continues to support its clients in a complex situation. The firm did not offer color on which positions impacted its equities business, though JPMorgan reported a 5% drop in revenue in its equity markets group.
This rough year for IPOs has had some Silicon Valley investors, most notably Benchmark's Bill Gurley, arguing that it is the IPO process itself ‚Äî not the companies presented to the market ‚Äî that is the problem.
Wall Street is feeling Silicon Valley's pain. (Getty) More Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, unsurprisingly, thinks this year is merely a stark example of how public markets instill discipline on companies that otherwise didn't have much.
""I think the IPO process is alive and well in the United States,"" Solomon said Tuesday. ""I do think that we are going to see a rebalancing of this process of private capital formation.""
Solomon added that changes could be coming to how large companies grow and the length of time they stay private before beginning the IPO process, but said he sees the events of this year as a ""healthy adjustment."" Of course, ""healthy adjustment"" is exactly how one would expect the CEO of a bank that is pretty directly feeling the pain from some of these IPOs to explain away the market's current view of the space.
But while both bankers and venture capitalists work to prove why WeWork isn't the beginning of a new, frosty period in markets but merely an outlier, along the way the hits being taken are real.
It's part of the reason why officials like Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren have called out the risks WeWork's stumbles pose to the broader commercial real estate market. And why WeWork's non-entry to the public market doesn't mean the story is going away anytime soon.

173,cryptocurrency,"Stock market news: October 31, 2019","U.S. stocks slid Thursday following reports that Chinese officials doubted whether a trade deal would get done. Some weaker-than-expected new economic data also contributed to a sell-off in risk assets. Gold and Treasuries were bid higher.
Meanwhile, investors also continued to digest the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate cut and commentary, as well as a host of major corporate quarterly results as earnings season rolled on.
Here‚Äôs where the markets settled at the end of regular equity trading:
S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ): -0.3%, or 9.21 points
Dow ( ^DJI ): -0.52%, or 140.46 points
Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ): -0.14%, or 11.62 points
WTI crude oil prices: ( CL=F ): -1.6% to $54.18 per barrel
10-year Treasury yield ( ^TNX ): -11.2 bps to 1.684%
Gold ( GC=F ): +1.14% to $1,513.70 per ounce
Chinese officials have reportedly suggested that they will not be willing to make concessions on some of the major economic reforms the Trump administration has called for to reach an eventual long-term trade deal, according to a Bloomberg report Thursday citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.
The officials are also reportedly concerned that President Donald Trump may renege on the phase one trade agreement the two sides have aimed to get in writing by mid-November. Contracts on the major U.S. stock indices fell following the report.
However, President Donald Trump later added kindling to hopes that the first phase of a trade deal would get signed.
‚ÄúChina and the USA are working on selecting a new site for signing of Phase One of Trade Agreement, about 60% of total deal, after APEC in Chile was canceled do to unrelated circumstances,‚Äù Trump wrote in a Twitter post around market open. ‚ÄúThe new location will be announced soon. President Xi and President Trump will do signing!‚Äù
Earlier, futures had been higher after the Federal Reserve‚Äôs third consecutive ease to the benchmark interest rate this year Wednesday afternoon. In their monetary policy statement, Federal Open Market Committee members suggested that rates may not go any lower in the near-term unless the economic outlook deteriorates further.
In his subsequent press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested rates would not go higher, either, unless inflation bumped up ‚Äì a catalyst that seems far-removed in the near-term given recent persistently low inflationary signals.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More But while the Fed may have steered market expectations away from its previously more dovish posturing, other central banks continued to hint at further accommodation. The Bank of Japan on Thursday kept benchmark interest rates unchanged but doubled down on a pledge to lower interest rates in the event that inflation slows further. Japan‚Äôs core inflation in September was a paltry 0.3%, well below the central bank‚Äôs 2.0% target.
The BOJ, in its October monetary policy statement, added a line saying it expects rates to remain ‚Äúat their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.‚Äù
Earnings A host of consumer-facing corporate names reported quarterly earnings Wednesday after market close, with most of these results coming in ahead of expectations.
Apple ( AAPL ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue of $64 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, beating expectations for $2.83 in adjusted EPS on sales of $63.01 billion, according to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data. The company topped expectations for both Services and iPhone sales, suggesting the tech giant‚Äôs hardware demand remains intact even as it expands its ecosystem to include software offerings. Apple‚Äôs guidance for holiday quarter sales and margins also exceeded the Street‚Äôs expectations.
Facebook ( FB ) surpassed top- and bottom-line expectations from the Street as the social media company‚Äôs core advertising business remained resilient despite scrutiny over its political ads and data policies and recent cryptocurrency ambitions. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $2.12 per share on revenue of $17.65 billion were stronger than the $1.91 per share on revenue of $17.35 billion expected. Daily and monthly active users of 1.62 billion and 2.45 billion, respectively, were roughly in-line with consensus.",2019-10-31T17:31:00.000+02:00,yahoo.com,stock|*|slide|*|thursday|*|follow|*|report|*|chinese|*|official|*|doubt|*|trade_deal|*|weak|*|expect|*|new|*|economic|*|datum|*|contribute|*|sell|*|risk|*|asset|*|gold|*|treasury|*|bid|*|high|*|investor|*|continue|*|digest|*|federal_reserve|*|late|*|interest_rate|*|cut|*|commentary|*|host|*|major|*|corporate|*|quarterly|*|result|*|earning|*|season|*|roll|*|market|*|settle|*|end|*|regular|*|equity|*|trading|*|point|*|dow|*|point|*|nasdaq|*|point|*|wti|*|crude|*|oil|*|price|*|cl|*|f|*|barrel|*|treasury|*|yield|*|bps|*|gold|*|gc|*|f|*|ounce|*|chinese|*|official|*|reportedly|*|suggest|*|-pron-|*|willing|*|concession|*|major|*|economic|*|reform|*|trump_administration|*|reach|*|eventual|*|long_term|*|trade_deal|*|accord|*|bloomberg|*|report|*|thursday|*|cite|*|unnamed|*|people|*|familiar|*|matter|*|official|*|reportedly|*|concern|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|renege|*|phase|*|trade|*|agreement|*|aim|*|writing|*|mid|*|november|*|contract|*|major|*|stock|*|index|*|fall|*|follow|*|report|*|president_donald|*|trump|*|later|*|add|*|kindling|*|hope|*|phase|*|trade_deal|*|sign|*|china|*|usa|*|work|*|select|*|new|*|site|*|signing|*|phase|*|trade|*|agreement|*|total|*|deal|*|apec|*|chile|*|cancel|*|unrelated|*|circumstance|*|trump|*|write|*|twitter|*|post|*|market|*|open|*|new|*|location|*|announce|*|soon|*|president|*|xi|*|president_trump|*|signing|*|early|*|future|*|high|*|federal_reserve|*|consecutive|*|ease|*|benchmark|*|interest_rate|*|year|*|wednesday|*|afternoon|*|-pron-|*|monetary|*|policy|*|statement|*|federal|*|open|*|market|*|committee|*|member|*|suggest|*|rate|*|lower|*|near|*|term|*|economic|*|outlook|*|deteriorate|*|-pron-|*|subsequent|*|press_conference|*|federal_reserve|*|chair|*|jerome|*|powell|*|suggest|*|rate|*|higher|*|inflation|*|bump|*|catalyst|*|far|*|remove|*|near|*|term|*|recent|*|persistently|*|low|*|inflationary|*|signal|*|trader|*|work|*|floor|*|new_york|*|stock|*|exchange|*|nyse|*|new_york|*|october|*|reuters|*|brendan|*|mcdermid|*|fed|*|steer|*|market|*|expectation|*|away|*|-pron-|*|previously|*|dovish|*|posturing|*|central_bank|*|continue|*|hint|*|accommodation|*|bank|*|japan|*|thursday|*|benchmark|*|interest_rate|*|unchanged|*|double|*|pledge|*|lower|*|interest_rate|*|event|*|inflation|*|slow|*|far|*|japan|*|core|*|inflation|*|september|*|paltry|*|central_bank|*|target|*|boj|*|-pron-|*|october|*|monetary|*|policy|*|statement|*|add|*|line|*|-pron-|*|expect|*|rate|*|remain|*|-pron-|*|present|*|low|*|level|*|long|*|-pron-|*|necessary|*|pay|*|close|*|attention|*|possibility|*|momentum|*|achieve|*|price|*|stability|*|target|*|lose|*|earning|*|host|*|consumer|*|face|*|corporate|*|report|*|quarterly|*|earning|*|wednesday|*|market|*|close|*|result|*|come|*|ahead|*|expectation|*|apple|*|aapl|*|post|*|adjust|*|earning|*|share|*|revenue_of_billion|*|-pron-|*|fiscal|*|fourth|*|quarter|*|beat|*|expectation|*|adjust|*|eps|*|sale|*|billion|*|accord|*|bloomberg|*|compile|*|consensus|*|datum|*|company|*|expectation|*|services|*|iphone|*|sale|*|suggest|*|tech_giant|*|hardware|*|demand|*|remain|*|intact|*|-pron-|*|expand|*|-pron-|*|ecosystem|*|include|*|software|*|offering|*|apple|*|guidance|*|holiday|*|quarter|*|sale|*|margin|*|exceed|*|street|*|expectation|*|facebook|*|fb|*|surpass|*|line|*|expectation|*|street|*|social_medium|*|company|*|core|*|advertising|*|business|*|remain|*|resilient|*|despite|*|scrutiny|*|-pron-|*|political_ad|*|datum|*|policy|*|recent|*|cryptocurrency|*|ambition|*|quarterly|*|adjusted_earning|*|share|*|revenue_of_billion|*|strong|*|share|*|revenue_of_billion|*|expect|*|daily|*|monthly|*|active|*|user|*|billion|*|billion|*|respectively|*|roughly|*|line|*|consensus
174,cryptocurrency,How Democratic candidates plan to protect American jobs from automation,"Democratic presidential candidate entrepreneur Andrew Yang speaks during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate in Westerville, Ohio, U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton More Democratic presidential candidates clashed over automation and what it means for American workers during the fourth debate on Tuesday night.
It‚Äôs an issue Andrew Yang has highlighted in previous debates ‚Äî but this time, the rest of the candidates had a chance to explain their strategy to combat potential job losses .
Universal Basic Income ‚ÄúI've been talking to Americans around the country about automation . And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS,‚Äù said Yang.
Yang says he would tackle the problem with his signature proposal: a ‚Äú freedom dividend ‚Äù of $1000 per month for every American adult.
‚ÄúWhen we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.‚Äù
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro said they would be open to some form of universal basic income.
‚ÄùAs people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives,‚Äù said Gabbard. ‚ÄúI think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.‚Äù
Accountable Capitalism Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said strengthening social security is a better answer than UBI. Warren also argued trade policy is largely to blame for job losses.
‚ÄúThe principal reason [for job losses] has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America,‚Äù said Warren.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks in a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN/New York Times at Otterbein University, Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, Ohio. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) More Warren pushed her plan for ‚Äú accountable capitalism ,‚Äù which would require workers to elect 40% of corporate board members. She says when workers are represented in boardroom discussions, they can fight decisions to automate jobs or move them overseas.
‚ÄúWe also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate,‚Äù added Warren.
Federal Job Guarantee Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said ‚Äúdamn right,‚Äù his federal job guarantee would provide work to every single American at risk of losing their job to automaton.
‚ÄúWe have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera,‚Äù said Sanders. ‚ÄúAnd the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.‚Äù
Yang responded to Sanders‚Äô plan saying he supported ‚Äúthe spirit‚Äù of a federal jobs guarantee ‚Äî but he questioned if it would actually work.
‚ÄúThe fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace,‚Äù said Yang. ‚ÄúIf you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.‚Äù
